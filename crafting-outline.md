# Crafting & Technology

## Technology Level is Cultural

- Technology Level (T0–T11) is a cultural shorthand, not a universal law.
- Different societies may exist at different TLs simultaneously.
- Example: On Earth, post-industrial societies coexist with hunter-gatherer groups.
- TL measures knowledge + tools + infrastructure available to a culture or craftsman.

## Everything is Craftable

- Every item in Atomic D6 is *theoretically craftable*, from flint knives to Dyson Spheres.
- Feasibility depends on Concept Bonus + Tech Distance + Narrative context.
- Items are never “forbidden” — only increasingly difficult.

## The Cost of Crafting

- Crafting costs time (man-hours).
  - Small items: a Beat or Scene.
  - Large projects: a Sequence or multiple Sequences.
- Materials and resources may also be consumed.

## Large construction projects

- Require a Domain Feat to craft.
- Can require thousands or millions of man hours.
- Major undertakings (castles, starships, Dyson Spheres) use Progress Clocks.

## Scaling for Progress Clocks

- The GM might rule that a stone-age human might require three Beats to craft a dugout canoe.
- An intergalactic Civilization might require three Beats to craft a Dyson Sphere.
- Each Beat requires Feat Dice and the Atomic D6 to be rolled.
- Length of a beat is subjective, based on the scope and scale of the Narrative.

## Crafting Difficulty Formula

Crafting Feat Difficulty is determined by:
1. Item TL → the tech level of the object.
2. Craftsman TL → the craftsman’s knowledge and tools.
3. Tech Distance → the difference between Item TL and Craftsman TL.

Tech Distance = Malus (½ Concept Bonus per TL step).
- Effective Dice Pool = Concept Bonus – (Distance × ½ Concept Bonus).
- If pool = 0 → Feat is impossible (unless GM fiat).
- Works both directions:
  - Too primitive = lack of knowledge/tools.
  - Too advanced = Lost Arts and forgotten traditions.

## Technology Levels Are Relative

- TLs are relative to the setting.
- Different worlds may develop along alternate paths.
- Example: A civilization might enter modernity without ever harnessing fossil fuels, advancing directly from wind, water, or geothermal to nuclear or fusion power.
- GMs are encouraged to reinterpret TLs to fit their world.

## Item Complexity Table

| Complexity     | Examples                         | Base Difficulty |
|----------------|----------------------------------|----------------|
| Simple         | Rope, arrow, clay pot            | 1 Success      |
| Advanced       | Sword, musket, potion            | 3 Successes    |
| Extraordinary  | Computer, mech suit, artifact    | 5 Successes    |
| Legendary      | FTL drive, Dyson Sphere, relic   | 7+ Successes   |

## Tech Distance Table

| Distance | Modifier (Malus)        | Feasibility |
|----------|-------------------------|-------------|
| 0        | No Malus                | Routine     |
| 1        | –½ Concept Bonus        | Hard        |
| 2        | –1 Concept Bonus        | Very Hard   |
| 3        | –1½ Concept Bonus       | Nearly Impossible |
| 4+       | Effective Dice Pool = 0 | Impossible  |

## Lost Arts Rule
- Some skills become harder at higher TLs because knowledge is forgotten.
- GM may add +1–3 Difficulty when replicating obsolete or obscure crafts.
- Example: Flint knapping at T6 = Difficulty 3 instead of 1.

## Examples

Bronze Age Smith (Concept Bonus +4, TL1) crafting a musket (T3, Advanced):
- Base = 3. Distance = 2 → Malus = –2.
- Effective Dice Pool = 4 – 2 = 2.
- Difficulty = 3. Very hard, but possible for a prodigy.

Cyberneticist (Concept Bonus +6, TL6) knapping flint (T0, Simple):
- Base = 1. Distance = 6 → Malus = –18.
- Effective Dice Pool = 0. Impossible without rediscovery.

Olympian Engineer (Concept Bonus +9, TL8) forging a Dyson Sphere (T9, Legendary):
- Base = 7. Distance = 1 → Malus = –4.
- Effective Dice Pool = 9 – 4 = 5.
- Difficulty = 7. Campaign-level project, but within reach.
