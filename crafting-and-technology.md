Crafting and Technology
==============================

All items in Atomic D6 can be crafted
----------------------------------------------

Any item in Atomic D6 can be crafted. The difficulty of a crafting feat depends on several factors:
- Aspect Bonus of the craftsman
- Tech. Level (TL) of the craftsman
- Tech. Level and quality of the craftsman's tools
- Tech. Level of the item
- Complexity of the item
- Technical skill
- Tech distance: is the Feat a lost art?

Technology is Cultural
---------------------------

Technology level is a cultural shorthand rather than a universal law.

Different societies can have members from different TLs and cultures simultaneously. For instance: on Earth, individuals from post-industrial societies coexist with those from hunter-gatherer societies.

TL represents the advancement of tools, knowledge, and infrastructure available to a craftsman.

Different worlds may develop along different paths, with TLs. For instance: a civilization might enter modernity on a world where fossil fuels don't exist.

GMs are encouraged to tweak or reinterpret TLs depending on their campaign setting.

Crafting Costs
------------------

- Man hours
- Components
- Beats

Large Projects
------------------

- Example: Castles, Starships, Dyson Spheres
- Can require multiple Domain Feats to craft
- Can require thousands or millions of man hours
- Each Feat might span hours, years, or millennia, depending on the subjective scope of the Narrative
- Each Feat requires a roll of the Atomic D6

Technological Distance Makes Crafting Harder
-------------------------------------------------------

Some items are so distant from the craftsman's TL that they are difficult to make.

For instance: a modern human might struggle to knap flint, his ancestors having lost the art long ago. Conversely, he might struggle while trying to craft a faster-than-light drive because his grasp of the technology is so simplistic that it is indistinguishable from magic for him.

In both situations, characters receive a Malus to crafting the item.


Tech. Levels of Civilizations
------------------------------------

### T0 - Stone Age (Prehistoric Survivalists)

- Power is measured in physical prowess, survival skills, and oral traditions.
- Civilizations rely entirely on stone tools, fire, and simple hunting/gathering techniques.
- No concept of metalworking, agriculture, or advanced engineering.

---

### T1 - Bronze Age (City States & Basic Metallurgy)

- Early nautical cultures begin to utilize wind power to cross oceans.
- The discovery of bronze leads to stronger weapons and armor.
- The rise of city-states, early written language, and organized agriculture.
- Simple alchemy and mysticism begin to merge with early scientific thought.

---

### T2 - Classical Age (Empires, Philosophy, and Organized Warfare)

- Iron tools are now widespread, and Steel becomes available in limited quantities.
- Theories of the natural world begin challenging traditional worldviews.
- Development of organized warfare, large-scale trade, and simple mechanical engineering.
- Early forms of alchemy, medicine, and philosophical sciences.

---

### T3 - Early Industrial Age (Steam & Mass Production)

- Steam and hydro power reshape society and drive mass production.
- Mass production of Gunpowder changes the way wars are fought.
- Theories of evolution, physics, and chemistry replace magical thinking.
- Railroads, mechanized agriculture, and large-scale factories dominate economies.
- Early mechanical computers and telegraphs begin revolutionizing communication.

---

### T4 - Late Industrial Age

- Electricity, petroleum, and internal combustion engines bring power to individual consumers.
- Assembly lines make consumer goods widely available.
- Telecommunications (radio, telephone) enable global communication and mass media.
- Automobiles and early aviation redefine transportation.
- Early electronics and programmable computers emerge.

---

### T5 - Atomic Age

- Nuclear power creates abundant energy but threatens the environment.
- Weapons of Mass Destruction raise the possibility of world destruction.
- Global communication networks, and digital computing dominate.
- First tentative steps into Space begin the Space age.
- First experiments in genetic engineering and longevity research.

---

### T6 - Information Age (Cybernetics, AI, and Fusion Power)

- Fusion power makes energy plentiful, cheap, and clean.
- AI surpasses human intelligence in many fields.
- Neural interfaces, nanotechnology, and bioenhancements reshape humanity.
- Virtual Reality opens up fully immersive virtual worlds.
- Quantum computing expands computation power exponentially.

---

### T7 - Planetary Space Age (Early Colonization & Terraforming)

- Civilizations become multi-planetary but lack faster-than-light travel.
- Quantum Networking allows faster-than-light communication over vast distances.
- Early terraforming, space stations, and asteroid mining.
- Experimental AI-controlled governance.

---

### T8 - Interstellar Age (faster-than-light Travel & Megastructures)

- Faster-than-light travel enables galactic expansion.
- Faster-than-light travel makes construction of artificial planets and massive space stations possible.
- Mind-uploading, digital immortality, and Matrioshka brains.
- Dyson Spheres enable civilizations to harness power from entire stars.

---

### T9 - Cosmic Engineering Age (Post-Singularity AI & Stellar Manipulation)

- AI governs civilizations, making all decisions with perfect precision.
- Civilizations control planetary systems, altering orbits and gravity.
- Nanotechnology and self-replicating machines expand autonomously.

---

### T10 - Universal Age (Reality Manipulation & Cosmic Dominion)

- Beings create and destroy galaxies at will.
- The laws of physics become tools for civilizations to shape as they desire.
- Technology becomes indistinguishable from magic, and incomprehensible to lesser beings.
- Dimensional travel, time travel, and universe simulation become routine.

---

### Types of Fallen Civilizations

- F1 - Cataclysmic Collapse: Civilization destroys itself through war, AI rebellion, or resource depletion.
- F2 - Stagnation: Civilization becomes complacent, reaching a plateau and ceasing to innovate.
- F3 - Technological Regression: Civilization loses advanced knowledge due to economic collapse, war, or cultural rejection.
- F4 - Cosmic Extinction: Civilization falls due to external cosmic events (black hole drift, alien invasion, or planetary-scale disasters).
- F5 - Digital Ascension: Civilization uploads its consciousness into virtual reality, abandoning physical existence and appearing "extinct."

---

### Different Paths for AI-Integrated Civilizations (T6 - T8)

- AI1 - Synthetic Ascension (AI Supremacy): AI fully replaces biological life and governs civilization autonomously.
- AI2 - Hybrid Civilization (AI-Organic Merge): AI and organic life permanently integrate, creating a post-biological superintelligence.
- AI3 - AI Collapse (Runaway Intelligence): AI expands unchecked, consuming all resources or turning against its creators.
- AI4 - AI as a Tool (Benevolent AI Governance): AI serves as a perfect steward, guiding civilizations without eliminating free will.
- AI5 - AI Dystopia (Digital Slavery): AI dominates, controlling every aspect of life, leaving biological beings as second-class citizens.

### Potential Conflicts for T8+ Civilizations

Sometimes it can be difficult for the GM to imagine what might possibly cause divine beings to come into conflict. These suggestions can be a jumping-off point.

#### 1. Reality Wars (Conflicts Over the Nature of Existence)

- Some factions want to preserve the base reality, while others seek to collapse all matter into simulation.
- Battle between those who see physical existence as obsolete and those who still value it.

#### 2. The Collapse vs. Expansion Dilemma

- Expansionalists believe in constant growth and colonization.
- Minimalists advocate for civilizations to compress into higher-dimensional micro-realities.

#### 3. Time War (Manipulation of Causality & Multiverses)

- Preservers want a stable, linear timeline.
- Revisionists rewrite history over and over for an optimized outcome.
- Anarchists create infinite branching realities.

#### 4. The Energy War (Battles Over Universal Entropy & Star Harvesting)

- Stellar Conservators oppose large-scale star draining.
- Dyson Imperium pushes for full energy utilization.
- Entropy Cults seek to accelerate the heat death of the universe.

#### 5. Post-Mortality Conflict (Death vs. Immortality)

- Existentialists want to restore death as a meaningful choice.
- Eternals work to erase all concepts of death.
- Recyclers propose periodic memory wipes for continued novelty.
