## What is an Aspect?

**Aspects are things that a character has.** As long as a character has an Aspect, it is true. If the Aspect ceases to be true, or if the character no longer has it, it is removed from their sheet.

## Character Creation

Fill out the following sections of your Character Sheet during creation:

### Aspects

Each character starts with **six core Aspects** that define them. The following Aspects are recommended, but GMs and Players may decide to start with different ones.

A character's Aspects grant them a bonus or a detriment to any skills that are relevant, and over the course of the game, they will gain new ones as their character changes over time.

1. **Concept**: A broad statement about who your character is at their core. This could be as simple as "Wandering Scholar" or as specific as "Cursed Prince Seeking Redemption."

2. **Background**: Your character‚Äôs history and past experiences. Where are they from? What key events shaped them?

3. **Heritage**: The culture and species your character hails from. This can grant traits, societal expectations, or inherited abilities.

4. **Strength**: A defining strength or talent that your character possesses, whether physical, mental, or emotional. This is something they can rely on in challenging situations.

5. **Bond**: A significant relationship or connection that holds meaning for your character. It could be a person, a group, or an ideal they hold dear.

6. **Flaw**: A weakness or shortcoming that makes your character more realistic. Flaws drive tension in the narrative and create interesting story opportunities.

## Rolls
Whenever players attempt to do something, the GM decides their chance of success, from *Awful* to *Superb*, and grants them a number of D6. Players also roll the *Atomic D6*, which determines if they receive a Boon or a Bane.

If the roll is considered trivial or impossible, the GM may declare that a roll is not needed.

Rolls are always relative. For example, a player may attack with a powerful magical weapon, but if their target has exceptional armor, the GM might decide their chance of a successful attack is only "Middling," and ask them to roll 1d6.

Relative rolls are useful for resolving anything from small combats to battles between massive armies. The mechanic is still the same in a large battle. If the two sides are roughly equivalent, with the same number of advantages, the GM might rule that the player's chance of victory is still only "Middling," and they still roll just 1d6.

That's the power of the Atomic D6 Narrative Dice System: relative rolls allow the game to scale up infinitely with minimal calculation.

Skill Dice

| 1-3    | Failure     |

| Difficulty  | Die to Roll      | % Chance of Success |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Superb      | 5D6 keep highest | 91%                 |
| Excellent   | 4D6 keep highest | 87%                 |
| Great       | 3D6 keep highest | 74%                 |
| Good        | 2D6 keep highest | 58%                 |
| Middling    | 1D6              | 50%                 |

The Atomic D6
--------

| Result | Description                   |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| 5-6    | Boon, something good happens. |
| 3-4    | Nothing                       |
| 1-2    | Bane, something bad happens.  |

Example Rolls:
--------

- **Success with Boon**: The player attacks successfully, gaining an additional benefit (e.g., catching the opponent off-balance and getting a second attack).
- **Success**: The player strikes their target successfully.
- **Success with Bane**: The player hits but leaves themselves open for counterattack.
- **Failure with Boon**: The player misses, but the enemy also falters in some way.
- **Failure**: The player misses outright.
- **Failure with Bane**: The player fails and suffers an additional setback (e.g., their weapon breaks**.

## Notice / Stealth Rolls

**Single Observer Noticing a Single Target**

Characters can make a Notice roll to determine whether they sense something. It is implied that characters that have been noticed against their will have failed at Stealth.

The GM may also choose to roll for Stealth instead of having the players roll to Notice something. The GM may prefer this method in certain situations to avoid giving away information and preserve the element of surprise.

When determining the difficulty of a Notice or Stealth roll, the GM should consider the following factors:
* Stealth of the target
* How alert is the observer?
* How noisy is the environment?
* Is the target actively trying to Stealthy?
* How good are the senses of the observer?
* Training and experience (for instance- Rangers receive Bonuses in wilderness environments)
* How much time is the observer spending trying to Notice the target

**Group Stealth / Notice Rolls**

In the case where an entire group of characters is attempting to Notice or Stealth, the GM has multiple options:

* Let them make one roll for the entire group, adjusting the difficulty accordingly
* Let each individual in the group roll. If more than half succeed, the whole group succeeds.

When GMs are calculating difficulty, it's worth considering that in many cases, groups are only as stealthy as their noisiest member.

**Noticing Inanimate Objects** works the exact same way, with some additional considerations that should be taken into account by the GM:

If the object has been crafted to be hidden or camouflaged, the GM can take the craftsman's skill into account when determining the Stealth roll of the object.

## Reaction Rolls

## Turn-Based Play

In certain situations where time is essential, the GM may decide that turn-based play is needed.

1** Turn Order is decided:
--------

The party that spots the other first takes the offensive.

Parties that succeed on their spot roll get to act first. If they fail, they act last.

By default, when it is the party's turn to act, the players take their turns around the table clockwise. Players may also decide on an alternate turn order in cases when they want to coordinate their actions.

2) Players take Action
--------

When a player announces their action, the GM assigns a difficulty to their roll, and they roll the appropriate number of dice.

In combat, the difficulty of the roll should take into consideration the target's armor, their ability to parry, dodge, and resist, their level of alertness, and any other mitigating factors.

If the player succeeds on their roll, their attack is successful. A failure means their attack missed or was negated by their opponent's actions. A failure with Bane might even grant the enemy an immediate counterattack.

Players may move either before or after they attack. A typical mortal can move about one zone per combat turn without magical or technological augmentation.

Players may also speak in turn-based play, but they are limited to ten syllables per turn.

2) Players Defend
--------

Notably, Atomic D6 is different from other popular TTRPG systems in that it is asymmetric. NPCs usually do not roll to defend or attack. The players roll. This is in accordance with the Atomic D6 philosophy of eliminating excess rolls wherever possible.

On the NPCs turn, the GM may move them and declare their attacks.

When NPCs attack, the players roll to defend. If the players fail, the attack succeeds.

Players may decide what kind of defensive action to take, for instance, they may dodge, block, parry, hide, counterspell, or even Judo throw. They're encouraged to be creative when narrating their actions.

Each of these actions have different difficulties depending upon the defender's situation, skills, and opponent.

For each additional attacker after the first that characters must defend against, they receive an additional Malus on their defensive rolls.

Defense and attack both come at a cost, and the GM may rule that a character in prolonged combat gains the "Fatigued" Aspect.

A Counterspell is bound by all of the same rules as any other magic spell. They are different only with regards to the fact that they are cast by a defender and they cannot take longer than one defensive turn to cast.

Counterspells do not simply cancel out enemy offensive actions: they are full fledged spells that defend by adding additional effects. For instance, an Aquamancer might summon a shield made of water to block an enemy fireball.

## Quick Skirmishes

If the story warrants that a combat should be resolved quickly, the GM determines the difficulty of the entire battle and lets one player roll.

Alternatively, the GM may allow each player to roll individually in order to decide their fate during the battle and how much they had to exert themselves.

---

## Large-Scale Battles

For larger battles, like a planetary invasion, the GM may run a series of Quick Skirmishes, each requiring its own roll.

- **Example Large-Scale Battle**:
  - **Stage 1**: The player's fleet begins an orbital bombardment. The GM rules a "Fair" chance of success, allowing 2D6. They roll and get *Success with Bane*. The players destroy the planet's orbital defenses, but lose 30% of their troops, and their capital ship is damaged.
  - **Stage 2**: Landing troops. The GM decides players have a "Good" chance to succeed, since they have already destroyed most of the planet's orbital defenses. They roll and succeed without Bane or Boon.
  - **Stage 3**: Occupying the capitals. The players roll a *Failure with Boon*, meaning they capture only one capital but gain a potential ally that offers to help them seize power in exchange for acting as their planetary governor.

## Glossary

- **Boon**: A positive narrative beat
- **Bane**: A negative narrative beat
- **GM**: Game Master, the game's storyteller and referee.
- **1D**: One six-sided die.
