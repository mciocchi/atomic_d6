# TODO Rules at a Glance

# Why is this game called Atomic D20?

The Atom is the smallest stable unit found in nature. Despite its small size, it contains a great deal of potential energy, and it can be combined into a multitude of different forms. In that sense, this game seeks to embody the qualities of its namesake.

# The Five Mutually Reenforcing Design Principles of Atomic D20

Fun
---
Above all else, we will strive to make our rules fun, even at the expense of our other principles.

Speed
-----
A faster game is an exciting game, and exciting games are fun.

Simplicity
----------
We will strive to do more with less, which will make our game faster to understand and play.

Extensibility
-------------
We will prefer open-ended rules that can be extended by players and the community, which will help us do more with less.

Scalability
-----------
We will prefer rules that can handle a wide range of power levels and situations consistently, which will help keep things simple.

# Boons and Banes, and Skill Checks

### Boons

Boons represent advantages that characters have. As characters improve Aspects of themselves, their Boons get larger, and they roll progressively larger dice.

For example, our Black Knight, Tertius is a Journeyman. The experiences and knowledge that he has acquired represent a significant advantage, and so he gets to roll at least D20 + 2D8 when he attacks with his axe, in contrast to an Unskilled character who would only roll D20.

### Banes

Conversely, a Bane is an Aspect of a character that disadvantages them in some way.

Tertius is not exactly a people person. When he returns to town, his axe has become dull from use, and he seeks out a blacksmith to sharpen it.

The Blacksmith attempts to charge Tertius five gold pieces. Tertius balks, and tries to convince him to do it for free.

It could be argued that Tertius' past experiences as a Journeyman Black Knight might have involved dealing with this Blacksmith in the past, which would allow him to use that as a Boon in this situation, bringing his argument up to D20+2D8.

Tertius was recently in a fight against his rival, the Wizard Ephora. He barely escaped with his life, with severe burns on his face to show for it.

The wound that Tertius received granted his character an Aspect called "magical burns on face." His visage is repulsive, and this grants him a Bane to social interactions when trying to get people to like him. The Bane counteracts the Boon, bringing his roll down from D20+2D8 to D20+1D8!

If Tertius had no more Boons to take away, he would roll D20 twice and take the lowest value.

If he had multiple Boons of different sizes, his Boons would be removed in order of highest to lowest.

# Aspects

Aspects are things that a character has. As long as a character has an Aspect, it is true. If the Aspect ceases to be true, it is crossed out or removed from the character's sheet.

### Aspects can be double-sided

Tertius has burns on his face. It's something he has, so it's an Aspect.

He realizes that he's getting nowhere with the stubborn Blacksmith. He grabs the young man's throat in his gauntleted hand, turns the burned side of his face toward him, and says "Why don't you go ahead and grant me a discount as a longstanding customer?"

In this case, the DM rules that Tertius' burns grant him a Boon to intimidating the Blacksmith. The DM already ruled that Tertius could apply his 2D8 Boon as a Journeyman Black Knight in this social situation because they had a prior relationship. Together, the Boons bring Tertius' roll up to D20+3D8.

Like the burns on Tertius' face, a character's Aspects can be double-sided. In certain situations, at the discretion of the DM, a Bane can become a Boon, or a Boon can be turned into a Bane, and there are also situations where they provide neither.

### Concept

A character's Concept is a specific type of Aspect that encapsulates what they do. A Concept doesn' have to be about combat. It could be a profession, a vocation, or something else.

When Tertius was a young man, he pledged fealty to the Order of the Ossuary to become a Black Knight. He chose it as his life path, and so it became his character's Concept.

He has progressed to the level of a Journeyman, which means he has earned three Boons, equivalent to 3D8. Tertius placed two of those into his Concept, which means he can add an additional 2D8 to any rolls that he makes that relate to his experience as a Black Knight.

### Expertise

Within his studies as a Black Knight at the Order of the Ossuary, Tertius Dabbled in Necromancy. Knowledge of the Necromantic arts is something that Tertius has, so it's another Aspect of his character.

Tertius receives a Boon to casting Necromantic spells because of his Aspect. He's a Journeyman, so the boon is 1D8.

As an important sidenote: the Black Knight Concept does not include spellcasting, so it does not grant Tertius a Boon in that regard.

It goes without saying that by splitting his training between spellcasting and melee, Tertius will not be as powerful as characters that focus only on spellcasting or only on melee.

DMs are advised to avoid allowing overly broad character Concepts in their game. This can allow characters to apply their Concept bonus to both melee and spellcasting, which tends to create hybrid characters that are overpowered. For this reason, Tertius cannot apply his Black Knight Concept to his Necromantic spells.

### Equipment

Tertius' equipment is something that he has, so it's another Aspect of his character.

Equipment is special because it doesn't progress like other Aspects. When Tercius went from an Apprentice to Journeyman Black Knight, his Boon Dice went from D6 to D8 as his skills sharpened with experience. Despite that, his equipment stayed the same.

He still fights with the axe that he trained with. The weaponsmith was an Apprentice, and so the axe adds a boon of D6 to the 2D8 that he gets from his Concept.

In general, the Boon granted by weapons and equipment is dependent upon the Boon of the craftsman at the time they were created.

# Practiced Maneuvers

In Atomic D20, any character may attempt anything, but success is never guaranteed.

By taking an hour to practice maneuvers at the beginning or end of the day, characters may improve their chances of success and receive a Boon.

Practiced Maneuvers are distinct from Aspects because they're something that characters do, not something that they have. The other requirement of Practiced Maneuvers is that they have to be specific, rather than general.

Characters have limited time to practice Maneuvers, but they can practice more as they become more efficient with experience.

As a Journeyman, Tercius can practice and grant himself a Boon in three specific maneuvers per day. He practices trip attacks, summoning skeletons, and summoning bone javelins.

Tercius can attempt to do anything, but he gains an extra boon in these three Maneuvers over and above those granted by his other Aspects.

# TODO Adjusting story difficulty

# TODO Spellcasting
# TODO Spellburn Resistance?

Spells are a particular kind of maneuver which involve bending the rules of the universe itself.

Spellburn
-----------
Bending the rules of the universe to one's will is not without its cost. Spells differ from other maneuvers in that when a spell fails, the caster loses some of their life force. Players take severe (2d6) damage each time a spell fails.

TODO: Spellburn only on failure, or on every cast?

Paradox
---------
Magic is still mysterious and poorly understood. It has been observed that occasionally, the same exact spell will get more difficult when cast repeatedly.  Other spells that seem to break the laws and expectations of the universe also experience this phenomenon.

Wizards who have experienced this describe it as the universe exerting its own will and pushing back against a paradoxical situation that should not be happening.

# Health and Wounds
# TODO Stamina that death spirals, like exhaustion

Characters have three kinds of health on their sheet. Stamina is represented by a pair of lungs. The state of a character's body is represented by hearts, and their mental state is represented by brains.

Most humanoids have one unit of Stamina, three units of physical health, and three units of mental health, but this is not necessarily always true. 

Stamina is special because it can be consumed in place of a minor physical or mental wound. Consuming Stamina in this way represents a character expending their energy to take evasive action. In addition, some actions like sprinting or concentrating for a long period of time are particularly taxing and they may also consume a character's Stamina.

Minor Wounds
------------
If 9 damage or less is inflicted upon a character, they receive a Minor Wound. Minor physical wounds represent cuts and bruises, and they consume one Heart or Stamina.

Minor mental wounds represent things like anxiety, depression, and trauma, and they consume one Brain or Stamina.

A Minor Wound in a particularly annoying place might incur a temporary Bane upon the character whenever they attempt to use that body part.

Major Wounds
------------
When a character takes 10 or more damage, they receive a Major Wound. Major wounds consume two units of physical or mental health and they always incur a Bane.

Major Wounds may be permanent, or they may take as few as 7 days to heal. A particularly bad wound like an amputated limb might even render the affected body part completely nonfunctional.

When all of a character's Hearts are consumed, they begin to die (see the corresponding section on Death for more details)

When all of a character's Brains are consumed, their personality is permanently destroyed, and they become catatonic.

Nonlethal Damage
----------------
Characters may choose to specify that they are attempting to deal nonlethal damage. At that point, their target becomes unconscious instead of dying when all of their Hearts or Brains are consumed. Attacks with firearms and certain spells cannot be made nonlethal, but most blunt melee attacks can.

Wound Locations
---------------
Physical wounds are localized to specific parts of a character's anatomy. If a character receives one as the result of an attack or failed maneuver, the DM may use the result of that roll in order to determine its location:

|D20 result:|Wound Location:|
|-----------|---------------|
|20         |Head           |
|19         |Neck           |
|18         |Upper Torso    |
|17         |Lower Torso    |
|15-16      |Groin          |
|13-14      |Right Arm      |
|11-12      |Left Arm       |
|10         |Right Hand     |
|9          |Left Hand      |
|8          |Right Leg      |
|7          |Left Leg       |
|6          |Right Foot     |
|5          |Left Foot      |
|3-4        |Right Shoulder |
|1-2        |Left Shoulder  |

# TODO Mental Wounds

# Healing

A character's Stamina recovers after a half hour rest without strenuous activity.

For each Minor Wound that they have, Characters may roll D20 when they wake up each morning. If they roll 8 or more, the wound is healed. The second day, the DC is 6.  On the third day, the DC is 4.

Characters must wait until the morning of the seventh day in order to roll to heal a Major Wound. The DC to heal a Major wound is 14. At the DM's discretion, even after they heal, some Major Wounds inflict permanent changes.

TODO How does magical / alchemical healing work?

# Death:

When all of a character's wound slots are filled, they begin to die, and they may choose how to spend their last breaths:

Inspiring last words:
---------------------
You are mortally wounded, but your death need not be in vain. You use your last burst of energy to utter rousing last words which grant all allies within hearing distance a boon which they may use however they wish within the next ten minutes.

Adrenaline:
-----------
You take your last breaths and adrenaline keeps you functioning and grants you a boon to use however you want before you die. In addition, you take an extra turn right at this moment. At the end of that turn, you die.

Miraculous Recovery:
--------------------
You become incapacitated and focus all your energy on staying alive. Roll d20 this turn and on each subsequent turn until you die or return to consciousness:
```
D20     Result
==============
19-20:  Against all odds, you open your eyes and become conscious again
11-18:  Survive for another turn
1-10:    Slip into the abyss and die
```

# TODO Defensive Actions

# Defense and Armor Paradigms

Subtraction
-----------
* Stays constant and eventually gets rendered irrelevant because player defensive skill is much higher.
more HP
+ Automatically separates flat-footed AC from reflex because they use different mechanics

Harder to hit (+ modifier to all defensive rolls)
-------------------------------------------------
+ Tried and true
+ Simplest system
- flat-footed AC - only armor - unaware target
- Touch AC - only reflex - Spell Save
- Regular AC - Reflex + Armor

More HP
-------
* This is almost the same as subtraction
- Cannot be dynamically adjusted with Maneuvers

Additional Armor Save
---------------------
- just add to defense roll, it's quicker and easier.

Other factors to consider:
* Mobility / Evasion
* Reduce Stamina

Parry
Block - Requires shield
Dodge
Riposte
Q: Can you have Armor Skill?
Q: Should Armor Scale?
What about the disadvantages of armor? Those should also scale.
A: That's why we deal with Boons and Banes instead of raw numbers. Boons and Banes scale, and raw numbers don't.

Heavy Armor:
Medium Armor:
Light Armor:
Unarmored:

Maybe armor and items shouldn't scale? In this paradigm, players would be forced to craft items and go out into the world to find them.

Nevertheless, the effect remains the same. In that case, the armor scales up and the player does not.

Apprentice crafted Heavy Armor receives an Apprentice level Major Boon to defense. It also provides an Apprentice level Major Bane to Spellcasting and Stealth.

Done deal.

Penalties for Heavier Armor
---------------------------
- Heavier armor has a higher chance of causing a Spell Failure.
- Heavier armor gives penalties to sneaking
- Penalties to stamina

Q: Should Boons be able to be stacked, or should they cap off at Major?

Items complicate character scaling tremendously by stacking Boons.

Consider: Players are always going to find ways to stack bonuses and break the system. The parties that want to do that will gravitate to that sort of behavior. Don't worry about it. Instead, just make sure there is no single dominant strategy and the system scales gracefully.
