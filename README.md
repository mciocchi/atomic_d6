Rules at a Glance
================================================================================

Character Concept
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Character Concept encapsulates the core of a character's persona and determines which Aspects they're allowed to choose.

Concept is always accompanied by a number in parenthesis called Concept Bonus, which indicates the scope and scale of a Character's power.

Concept Bonus is only applied to a Feat if the Character has an Aspect related to the thing they're attempting to do.

Aspects
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Characters in Atomic D6 have a list of points that describe them that are called Aspects.

Aspects allow characters to apply their Concept Bonus to Feats that they are attempting.

Aspects must remain consistent with Character Concept: if it doesn't fit, the GM can ask players to pick a new one. For instance: the GM can rule that spellcasting is restricted to certain specialized Character Concepts.

If an Aspect ceases to be true, or if the Character Concept no longer has it, it is removed from their sheet.

An Aspect can provide Bonuses in some situations and Maluses in others: a slashed arm might grant a character a Malus on any actions using that limb, but it might grant them a Bonus when negotiating the price of a healing potion with a friendly shopkeeper.

It is recommended that GMs limit Characters to five Aspects or fewer at creation time, but they may gain more throughout the course of the Narrative.

### Species

In some settings, the GM can allow players to choose their Species. For game balance, players must work with the GM to make sure that their chosen Species has at least one significant Malus for each Bonus that it receives.

### Jack of all trades, master of none

The GM is expected to make sure that Aspects are specific enough that they do not apply too many different Feats. The GM has the right to knock Aspects like this down to a Half Concept Bonus if they're too broad.

In game terms, this represents characters dabbling across a broad group of Feats without developing mastery of any of them.

### Additional Requirements

Different tables may come to a consensus regarding what kind and how many Aspects are allowed. It is recommended that players generate characters together, at the same time, in order to make sure they're thematically and mechanically aligned.

Feat Die
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Characters roll a number of Feat Die equal to their Concept Bonus when attempting a Feat that directly benefits from one of their Aspects.

For example: “Swordsman” allows a Character to apply their Concept Bonus to all combat Feats with a Sword.

At the highest levels of Atomic D6, characters may receive Bonuses of +10 or higher. It is not recommended for players to roll more than 10 Feat Die at a time. In these situations, characters should convert die to a flat modifier.

For instance: a character with +13 would roll 10 Feat Die, and add +3

Characters always roll at least 1 Feat Die, even when their Maluses end up being greater than all of their Bonuses.

| Feat Dice Result: | Successes: |
|-------------------|------------|
| 1-3               | 0          |
| 4-5               | 1          |
| 6                 | 2          |

Feat Bonuses Summarized:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rules to resolve Feats in Atomic D6 may seem overwhelming at first, but there are only three numbers that characters actually need to remember:

| Feat relationship to Aspect:                 | Calculation (rounded): |
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Directly related                             | Full Concept Bonus     |
| Directly related but also subject to a Malus | 1/2 Concept Bonus      |
| Tangentially related                         | 1/2 Concept Bonus      |
| Tangentially related and subject to a Malus  | 1/3 Concept Bonus      |
| Not related                                  | 1/3 Concept Bonus      |
| Not related and subject to a Malus           | 1/3 Concept Bonus      |

Atomic D6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Atomic D6 is rolled whenever characters attempt a Feat. It represents narrative circumstances outside of their control that are independent of the success or failure of the Feat.

| Atomic D6 Result: | Description:                 |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| 1-2               | Bane: a negative story beat. |
| 3-4               | Neutral                      |
| 5-6               | Boon: a positive story beat. |

Half Bonus (Tangential Feats)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a character attempts a Feat that is only tangentially related to their Aspects, they may receive only a Half Bonus.

```
Half Bonus = round( Concept Bonus / 2)
```

Maluses
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An Aspect that hinders a character is called a Malus.

Characters subject to a Malus receive only a Half Bonus to Aspects that are affected by the Malus.

If the Feat that they are attempting is already tangental and also subject to a Malus, their Bonus is further reduced to 1/3, rounded.

For instance: because of his slashed arm, Kaelion receives a Malus to Swordsmanship, and he only gets a 1/2 Bonus to it until his arm heals.

Small Bonuses and Maluses
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The GM can grant Small Bonuses to represent minor advantages such as a freshly sharpened blade.

Granting players "a pip" (.1) allows them to turn a single dice into a higher number, which could be enough to turn failure into success in certain situations.

For instance, with +.1 a player could turn a 3 into a 4. With +.2 they could turn a 2 into a 4.

Players cannot have +.3 or higher. In these cases, each group of .3 is converted into a full dice (+1)

For instance: Kaelion has accumulated a bunch of minor bonuses to Swordsmanship equivalent to +.4. He converts them to full dice, and on his character sheet he writes +1.1

The double-success provided by rolling a 6 is not granted when making a 6 in this way. Only a single Success is granted in this case.

Passive Bonus
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Passive Bonuses are used to resolve situations where the defender can't or shouldn't roll a Feat.

Such situations may include:
- Unconscious characters
- Unaware characters
- inanimate objects
- any situation where rolling is happening too frequently, and one constant passive score is more convenient

For instance: Kaelion walks down the King's Road, past some brigands hiding behind trees, waiting in ambush.

The GM doesn't want to give away the situation, so instead of asking Kaelion to roll Notice, the GM can roll a Group Feat of Stealth for the Brigands and compare their result to Kaelion's Passive Bonus to Notice them.

Passive Bonuses are optional and situational. Some GMs may choose not to use them.

In the case that they are unconscious or unaware, the GM may apply a Malus to a character's Passive Bonuses to represent their inability to defend themselves.

```
To calculate a Passive Bonus, first convert Dice to Pips:
P = D * 3 + Additional Pip Bonuses

Then convert Pips to Passive Bonus:
PB = round(P / 5)
```

Floor for Defensive Feats
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To prevent automatic failure, all characters have a floor for Defensive Feats in particular.

```
Defensive Floor = round( Concept Bonus / 3 )
```

This floor is applied when a character is forced to use a Defensive Feat that does not benefit from any of their Aspects.

Contests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are three ways to resolve Feats that involve Characters, Groups, or Domains directly opposing one another:

**Active vs Active:** both sides roll their dice; higher number of successes wins.

**Active vs Passive:** one side rolls; the other uses their Passive Bonus.

**Passive vs Passive:** compare Passive Bonuses; higher total wins.

The GM may choose from these methods to determine how Feats are resolved.

Group Feats
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When two or more characters work together to perform a feat, if the majority succeed, the group succeeds. This rule can be used with either Active or Passive Feats.

The GM has the option to add or subtract a Bonus that scales to account for differences in difficulty caused by group size:
- A small group may receive +2 for Stealth, and -2 in combat against a larger group.
- If the groups are vastly outmatched in size, the GM can declare an automatic success or failure

Domain Feats
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At a certain size, resolving Group Feats begins to become unwieldy, and something more is needed.

Domains represent large groups that work together to perform Feats as a single unit.

Domains have a Concept and Aspects, and they function almost like Characters, but on a much grander scale.

The section on [Domains](#Domains) has more information.

Feats of Magic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spellcasting Aspects

Characters require at least one Spellcasting Aspect in order to cast spells.

Every Spellcasting Aspect must be tied to a school of magic, which defines the limits of a character's abilities.

Spellcasting Aspects may be granted by:

- the Domain of a Divine Patron (such as a God or Goddess)
- the academic study of a magical discipline (such as Pyromancy, Necromancy, or Illusion)
- inborn capabilities, accidents, or mutations
- cybernetic enhancements
- something else (be creative)

### Mana And Magical Strain

Characters with at least one Spellcasting Aspect have a mana pool. Mana represents how much magical strain a character can safely absorb during a Sequence. By default, each spellcaster has 3 mana at the start of each Sequence.

Some say that Mana is subject to the whims of the gods. It only refreshes when a new Sequence begins. It is not restored by eating, drinking, sleeping, or the passage of in-world time.

Magical strain may represent backlash, fatigue, and psychic stress caused by magic as it bends the fabric of reality.

### Casting a Spell

1. Declare Intent: The player announces that their character is attempting to cast a spell.
2. Describe the Spell: The player describes the effect in narrative terms.
3. GM Sets Difficulty: The GM determines the base difficulty for the spell.

   - Players are encouraged to build a grimoire of frequently used spells with their base difficulties written down.
   - The GM may modify the base difficulty depending upon situational Aspects (for example: target armor, magical wards, trying to be stealthy).
   - The GM should reward players for writing down spells by granting Small Bonuses for preparedness.

4. Roll Feat Dice + Atomic D6:

   - Roll as if casting were a Feat, applying the Spellcasting Aspect and any other Bonuses.
   - The Atomic D6 may generate special consequences.
   - Passive scores may not be used when casting spells: players must roll every time.

#### Calculating Spell Difficulty

When setting the difficulty for a spell (step 3), the GM uses the following formula:

```
Spell Difficulty = Paradox +
                   Duration +
                   Resistance Interval +
                   Targets/Area +
                   Resistance Difficulty +
                   Range +
                   Magnitude -
                   Preparation Time -
                   Number of Casters
                   Capped at 26, Floored at 0
```

The final result is capped at a maximum of 26 successes and floored at a minimum of 0 successes.

Paradox

Paradox is the first and most important variable for the GM to ascertain. It represents how "reality breaking" (read: game breaking) the spell is. The GM should assess how much the spell violates the world's natural laws or game balance. Paradox can change over time; even the same spell can change in difficulty if the circumstances of its casting are different, or if it is cast repeatedly. See the [Paradox](#Paradox) section for more information.

Duration

Duration uses in-game time, not narrative time. The GM must consider the actual in-world duration when determining difficulty. For instance: if a scene is 1000 years, the GM should make that spell much more difficult than a spell lasting a scene that is 5 minutes. The duration steps (Beat, Scene, Sequence, Act, Narrative, Permanent) are defined in the [Time](#Time) section.

Resistance Interval

Resistance Interval defaults to one step lower than Duration. For instance: if the duration is one Scene, the resistance interval will be one Beat. If the duration is one Beat, the resistance interval will be one Moment. The Resistance Interval represents how often targets can attempt to resist the spell's effects. See the [Resisting a Spell](#Resisting-a-Spell) section for more information.

Targets/Area

This variable accounts for the number of targets or the size of the area affected by the spell. Spells that affect multiple targets or larger areas are more difficult than spells affecting a single target or small area.

Resistance Difficulty

This usuallly defaults to the total difficulty of the spell, and represents how difficult it is for targets to resist its effects. Spells that are harder to resist (such as mind control or binding effects) add more to the difficulty than spells that are easier to resist.

Range

Range represents the distance from the caster to the target or the area of effect. Spells cast at greater distances are more difficult than spells cast at close range.

Magnitude

Magnitude represents the raw power or intensity of the spell's effect. More powerful effects reduce the spell's difficulty (this variable is subtracted from the total). The GM should consider the scale of the effect when determining Magnitude.

Preparation Time

Preparation Time represents the time spent preparing the spell before casting. Spells that are prepared over a longer period are easier to cast (this variable is subtracted from the total). Rituals and ceremonies that take hours or days reduce the spell's difficulty.

Number of Casters

When multiple casters work together to cast a spell, the difficulty is reduced (this variable is subtracted from the total). Each additional caster beyond the first reduces the difficulty, representing the shared burden of channeling magical energy.

### Spellcasting Outcomes

- Success: The spell is cast as intended.
- Failure: The spell fizzles and does not manifest.
- Boon:
  - The spell might be unexpectedly more powerful or produce an unexpected beneficial effect.
  - The spell's duration may be unexpectedly extended (GM's discretion, typically one step longer: Beat becomes Scene, Scene becomes Sequence, etc.).
  - The spell may be unexpectedly harder to resist.
  - Spells that are unexpectedly more powerful may also be dangerous to the player and their allies!
- Bane:
  - The caster takes a hit from magical strain, and loses 1 Mana and 1 Stamina, regardless of the success or failure of the spell.
  - Just like any other hit, if the character has no Stamina remaining, they suffer 1 Wound instead.
  - The spell may have unexpected negative effects.
  - The spell's duration may be unexpectedly shortened (GM's discretion, typically one step shorter: Scene becomes Beat, Sequence becomes Scene, etc.), or the spell may fail to take hold at all.
  - The spell may be unexpectedly easier to resist.
- Neutral:
  - The spell has no additional effects.

### Eldritch Burden

Characters may maintain one single conjured magical effect for extended periods of time.

Channeling powerful eldritch energies in this way causes visible effects. For instance: a pyromancer concentrating to maintain a spell might sprout magical flames from their eyes that grow higher depending on the power of the spell.

As long as a character is concentrating in this way, they cannot rest and recover Stamina or Wounds.

They may cast additional spells as long as they do not maintain effects over an extended period of time.

### Death by Magical Strain

When a character dies as a result of magical strain, powerful eldritch energies are released. The exact kind of eldritch energies varies depending upon the type of spell being cast, but the results can be unpredictable and spectacular. For instance: a pyromancer might explode in a violent fireball.

### Paradox

Magic is bound by the rules of the world. Characters who attempt to repeatedly bend or break those rules begin to strain the fabric of reality itself.

On rare occasions, bending the rules of reality in this way can cause Paradox, which makes subsequent castings of the same world-breaking spell increasingly difficult.

Some say that Paradox is caused by gods that wish to punish mortals for breaking the rules of the reality that they constructed. Others claim it is caused by reality itself pushing back against the caster. In any case, it can have narrative as well as mechanical consequences.

Resisting a Spell
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a spell targets a resisting character, treat their defenses as an extra layer of difficulty rather than a separate roll.

```
Spell Resistance = Target’s Defensive Feat (Can be Passive or Active, depending on the situation)
                   + Target's Armor (if applicable)
```

- The defender gets to choose which defensive Feat to use, as long as it's appropriate
  - Physical targeting: Dodge, Block, Endure, Cover, or similar
  - Mental or sensory effects: Resolve, or similar.
  - If the spell is a physical attack, armor may provide additional protection (see Armor and Spell Resistance below)
  - If the target lacks a relevant Aspect for that defense, use the standard Defensive Floor in place of their full Concept Bonus.

The caster rolls spellcasting as a normal Feat, applying their Spellcasting Aspect and other Bonuses. They must meet or beat the total Spell Resistance for the spell to fully take hold.

#### Example: Illusory Chains

A spellcaster with Illusion Bonus 3 casts an Apprentice‑level illusion to conjure chains that bind a thug’s arms and legs.
- Base spell difficulty (Apprentice effect): 2 successes.
- Thug rolls Dodge and receives 3 successes.
- The spellcaster must roll 2 or higher for the spell to be cast successfully
- The spell still misses unless the caster beats the defender by rolling 3 or higher

#### Spell Effects as Temporary Aspects

Spell effects such as chains, webs, or shackles are treated as a negative Aspect affecting the target (for example, “Entangled by Illusory Chains”).

- The Condition lasts while:
  - The caster maintains it as an ongoing conjured effect (subject to the existing concentration rules and Eldritch Burden), or
  - Any fixed, agreed-upon duration expires (for non-maintained effects).
  - While the Condition is active, the target has an Malus restricting them according to the spell’s description.

#### Attempting to Break Free Each Turn

A character affected by a spell in combat may attempt to break free at the end of each of their turns (Beats) as an Active Feat. This is separate from the initial resistance roll when the spell is cast.

- Choose a Feat that matches the nature of the spell:
  - Physical bindings (chains, webs, snares):
    - Endure, Melee, or a custom Feat such as Athletics.
  - Illusory / mental bindings (pure mind tricks, fear, phantasms):
    - Resolve, or a similar mental defense Feat.
  - Projectiles and conjured melee attacks
    - Dodge, Block, Cover
- Apply Aspects normally; tangential Aspects grant Half Bonus, Maluses reduce effectiveness as usual.

##### Escape Difficulty

Set the difficulty to escape as:

```
Escape Difficulty = Original Spell Difficulty + Caster's Passive Spellcasting Bonus
```

- Original Spell Difficulty is the same number the GM used when the spell was cast (for example, 2 for an Apprentice‑level effect).
- The caster's Passive Spellcasting Bonus is their spellcasting Concept Bonus converted to a Passive Bonus (round Concept Bonus ÷ 2, as with other Passive scores).

The bound character rolls once per turn at the end of their Beat. Meeting or beating the Escape Difficulty fully ends the Condition.

#### Armor and Spell Resistance

Armor provides protection against certain types of physical spell effects. When calculating Spell Resistance against physical spells, armor Bonus is added to the Active Defensive Feat Bonus, and then the total is converted to Passive Bonus using the standard formula.

```
Spell Resistance = Base Spell Difficulty + Target's Defensive Feat (with Armor Bonus if applicable)
```

**When Armor Applies to Spell Resistance:**

Armor provides protection against physical spell effects that would be blocked or mitigated by protective gear:

- Physical projectile spells (ice bolts, force missiles, stone projectiles)
- Conjured weapon attacks (magical swords, spears, arrows)
- Force-based attacks that create physical impact

**When Armor Does Not Apply to Spell Resistance:**

Armor provides limited or no protection against:

- Spells consisting of only Fire. (fire can cook someone alive inside armor, providing minimal protection at best)
- Energy-based attacks that bypass physical barriers (lightning, plasma)
- Mental or sensory effects (illusions, mind control, fear)
- Spells that target internal systems (poison, disease, life drain)

The GM determines whether armor applies to a specific spell based on the spell's description and the nature of its effects. When in doubt, consider whether the spell creates a physical effect that armor would realistically protect against.

### Spell Duration

When casting a spell, the caster declares the intended duration of the effect. The duration affects the spell's difficulty, with longer durations requiring more power to maintain.

#### Out-of-Combat Spell Resistance

When a spell is cast outside of combat, the target's opportunities to resist depend on the spell's duration:

- **Maintained Spells (Eldritch Burden)**: The target may attempt to break free when dramatically appropriate or when the spell effect is challenged. The GM determines when such opportunities arise based on the narrative.

- **Fixed-Duration Spells**: The target gets a resistance roll at natural breakpoints in the spell's duration:
  - Beat duration: At the end of each Beat (if combat begins)
  - Scene duration: At the end of the Scene
  - Sequence duration: At the end of the Sequence
  - Act duration: At the end of the Act
  - Narrative duration: At the end of the Narrative
  - Permanent duration: Only at the initial casting; no further resistance rolls unless the spell is dispelled or broken by other means

The Escape Difficulty for out-of-combat resistance uses the same formula as combat resistance:

```
Escape Difficulty = Original Spell Difficulty + Caster's Passive Spellcasting Bonus
```

Note: The Original Spell Difficulty includes the duration modifier that was applied when the spell was cast.

#### Examples: Spell Duration in Practice

**Example 1: Apprentice Mind Control (Fleeting Effect)**

Varo, an Apprentice Illusionist (Concept Bonus +2), attempts to charm a guard during a social encounter. He wants the effect to last for a Scene so he can pass through the gatehouse.

- Base spell difficulty (Apprentice-level mind control): 2 successes
- Duration: Scene (+1 modifier for Apprentice)
- Total Spell Difficulty: 3 successes required

Varo rolls his spellcasting Feat and gets 3 successes. The guard is charmed for the Scene. At the end of the Scene, the guard may attempt to break free using Resolve against the Escape Difficulty (3 + Varo's Passive Spellcasting Bonus of 1 = 4 successes).

**Example 2: Elder Deity Permanent Enchantment**

An Elder Deity (Concept Bonus +26) wishes to create a permanent curse that binds a mortal's soul to a specific location for all eternity.

- Base spell difficulty (Elder Deity-level curse): 13 successes
- Duration: Permanent (+0 modifier for Elder Deity)
- Total Spell Difficulty: 13 successes required

The Elder Deity rolls and succeeds. The curse is permanent. The mortal may only resist at the initial casting; once the spell takes hold, it cannot be broken through normal resistance rolls. Only powerful dispelling magic or divine intervention could end the effect.

**Example 3: Master-Level Spell with Boon**

A Master Pyromancer (Concept Bonus +6) casts a fire shield with Beat duration to protect themselves in combat.

- Base spell difficulty (Master-level protection): 3 successes
- Duration: Beat (+0 modifier for Master)
- Total Spell Difficulty: 3 successes required

The caster rolls and gets a Boon. The GM rules that the fire shield unexpectedly lasts for the entire Scene instead of just one Beat, giving the pyromancer extended protection.

Understanding Parts of the Atomic D6 Character Sheet
================================================================================
Stamina
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When a character takes damage, they lose Stamina. Consuming Stamina in this way represents a character getting the wind knocked out of them, or expending their energy to take evasive action.

At the GM's discretion, some actions like sprinting or concentrating for a long period of time are particularly taxing and may also consume Stamina.

If the character has no more Stamina at the time they take damage, they receive a Wound.

Wounds
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"It's just a flesh wound." - _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_

Wounds are Maluses that represent mental or physical damage to a character.

When characters take damage, they have to spend a point of Stamina, otherwise they are required to take a Wound.

Most heroes can sustain two Minor Wounds and one Major Wound. After that, if they get hit again, they begin to die.

#### Minor Wounds

Mild inconveniences that cause pain, distraction, and social issues. Recoverable within a matter of days. For instance:

- scratches
- grazes
- bruises
- first degree burns
- the shakes
- anxiety
- self-doubt

#### Major Wounds

Major Wounds are serious injuries which may have permanent consequences. They require specialized treatment, and even then, recovery may take weeks or months.

Some examples of Major Wounds are:
- Lacerations
- Sprains
- dislocations
- second and third degree burns
- concussions
- brain damage
- permanent psychological problems.
- broken bones
- amputations
- arterial bleeding

Characters may annotate their wound with the phrase (in treatment) after they have received aid. After the period of treatment is over, depending upon the quality of care that they received, Major Wounds can eventually be downgraded to a Minor Wound and heal naturally.

Even after healing, Major wounds can leave behind conditions that linger on. After the wound has healed, those conditions are added to a character's list of Aspects.

#### Conditions

Conditions can include:
- Knocked prone
- Unconscious
- Illness
- Starvation
- Thirst
- Poisoning
- Weakness
- Magical Curses
- Paralysis
- Amputation

These are added to Character's lists of Aspects while they are in effect.

#### Getting knocked out of the fight

Suffering the Death of a character or a permanent debilitating injury is not fun, but without consequences, player choices become meaningless.

Players should not be forced to play a character that they consider "unplayable."

In this case, they should work with the GM to roll a new character and cycle them into the Narrative. If their character was injured, they might be able to return after taking some downtime receiving treatment.

#### Eating and Drinking

Once every five hours, characters can recover Stamina naturally by taking 30 minutes of light activity to eat and drink.

Recovering Stamina in this way is a Feat with a difficulty of 1, but low quality rations make recovery more difficult.

When eating and drinking, players may roll once per point of stamina that they are attempting to recover.

It is not recommended for GMs to allow players to add their Concept Bonus to Feats of healing and Stamina recovery.

#### Sleeping
Wounds have a chance to heal naturally after characters have slept for eight hours.

Recovering from a Minor Wound by sleeping is a Feat with a difficulty of 2.

Upon waking, characters may roll once per Wound in order to determine if they have healed.

Certain species like robots do not eat, sleep, or drink, but they do require maintenance, and they have their own rules around stamina recovery.

Death
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"It is not death a man should fear, but rather, never beginning to live" - *Marcus Aurelius*

When a character takes damage and all of their Stamina and Wounds have already been consumed, they begin to die, and they may choose how to spend their last breaths:

#### Inspiring last words

You are mortally wounded, but your death need not be in vain. You use your last breaths to utter rousing last words which grant all allies within hearing distance a Bonus that they may use within the next Sequence.

#### Adrenaline

You take your last breaths and adrenaline keeps you functioning and grants you a Bonus to use however you want. In addition, you take an extra turn right at this moment. At the end of that turn, you die, regardless of any healing you receive.

#### Critical Condition

You become incapacitated and focus all your energy on staying alive. Roll D6 at this moment, and at the beginning of each subsequent turn until you die or return to consciousness:

| D6:  | Result:                                                                      |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-3: | Slip into the abyss and die.                                                 |
| 4-5: | Survive for another turn.                                                    |
| 6:   | Against all odds, you regain a point of Stamina and return to consciousness. |

If characters receive prompt medical attention, they may receive Bonuses to these rolls.

##### Death by Mental Wounds

_"some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age."_ - H.P. Lovecraft

In Atomic D6, Mental Wounds are considered to be just as deadly as physical ones. When a character dies due to Mental Wounds, their body remains in tact, but their personality is destroyed by the gravity of the cosmic horrors that they have witnessed. They are unresponsive, unable even to eat or drink, and nothing short of a magical or technological miracle can bring them back.

Character Progression
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Concept Bonus

A character's Concept Bonus represents the scope and scale of their power.

| Description: | Concept Bonus (Die Rolled + Additional Bonus): |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Untrained    | 1                                              |
| Apprentice   | 3                                              |
| Journeyman   | 5                                              |
| Master       | 7                                              |
| Olympian     | 10                                             |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Demigod      | 10+4                                           |
| Lesser Deity | 10+10                                          |
| Elder Deity  | 10+16                                          |

### Concept Bonus Advancement

When players learn, either through experience, or training, the GM can award them one or more advancements to their Concept Bonus.

For each advancement granted by the GM, it is recommended that the party should roll once for the entire group so that all characters improve at the same pace.

#### Small Advancement:

| D6: | Improvement to Concept Bonus |
|-----|------------------------------|
| 1-3 | +0                           |
| 4-5 | +.1                          |
| 6   | +.2                          |

#### Large Advancement:

| D6: | Improvement to Concept Bonus |
|-----|------------------------------|
| 1-3 | +0                           |
| 4-5 | +1                           |
| 6   | +2                           |

---

Wealth
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Wealth Levels for Individuals

Individual coins are never tracked in Atomic D6. When Characters gain or lose a significant amount of Wealth, the GM can award them an [Advancement](#Concept-Bonus-Advancement) to determine how much their Wealth Level increases or decreases.

| Bonus | Wealth Level                              | Examples of What Can Be Afforded                                                                                           |
|-------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Penniless                                 | Food scraps, patched clothes, makeshift shelter, improvised weapons.                                                       |
| 3     | Working-Class                             | Rent a room at an inn, buy travel gear, maintain a horse, or replace simple weapons.                                       |
| 5     | Professional / Tradesperson               | Own a small home or workshop, employ a few workers, purchase fine arms or armor.                                           |
| 7     | Noble / Merchant Lord                     | Own estates, ships, caravans, or businesses; employ guards; fund small expeditions.                                        |
| 10    | Magnate / Ruler of Fortune                | Maintain multiple estates, private armies, trade fleets, magical research, or political campaigns.                         |
|-------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 10+4  | Planetary Tycoon / Corporate Sovereign    | Control banks, megacities, or world-spanning industries; finance wars or planetary terraforming.                           |
| 10+10 | Interstellar Mogul                        | Build fleets, colonize worlds, monopolize stellar trade, or purchase entire moons.                                         |
| 10+16 | Galactic Financier / Post-Scarcity Entity | Buy star systems, fund galactic wars, create artificial planets, or rewrite entire markets through divine or cosmic means. |

### Buying goods and services from a different Tech. Level

When buying items that belong to a different tech level, the price is modified accordingly.

These prices are approximate, and subject to change. In general, prices are not discounted more than -4 because lower TL items can be scrapped for raw materials.

| Character TL - Item TL: | Approximate Price Difference: |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| -2                      | -4                            |
| -1                      | -2                            |
| 0                       | 0                             |
| 1                       | 2                             |
| 2                       | 4                             |
| >2                      | N/A (cannot be bought)        |

#### Antiquities

One notable exception to this rule is certain rare lower TL items that are considered "antiquities." Antiquities appreciate in value over time and can fetch exorbitant prices from collectors.

Feats (Continued)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Defensive Feats

For contested actions, defenders may choose how they wish to defend themselves.

Common Defensive Feats:

- Dodge – Jump out of the way to avoid the attack
- Block – Use a shield or object to absorb impact
- Parry – Redirect or deflect the attack using a weapon
- Cover – Take shelter behind an obstacle
- Counterspell – Interrupt a spell with a spell of your own
- Judo Throw – Redirect an attack's momentum away from you
- Something else (be creative, add it to your Character Sheet)

After a character chooses their defensive Feat, they work with the GM to determine whether it receives a Bonus or Malus from their Aspects.

If the character is wearing armor, the armor's Bonus is added to the Active Defensive Feat Bonus, and then the total is converted to Passive Bonus. Note that heavy armor may impose Maluses on certain Defensive Feats (especially Dodge). See the [Armor](#Armor) section for details.

### Armor

Armor provides protection by making characters harder to hit. Armor Bonus is added to Active Defensive Feats, and then the total is converted to Passive Bonus using the standard formula.

#### Armor as Bonus

Armor provides a Bonus that is added to a character's Active Defensive Feat Bonus. The total (Active Defensive Feat Bonus + Armor Bonus) is then converted to Passive Bonus using the standard formula:

```
Passive Bonus = round((Active Defensive Feat Bonus + Armor Bonus) / 2)
```

Armor's Bonus always applies to physical attacks in addition to any Defensive Feat chosen, except in situations where armor can be bypassed (see Situations Where Armor Does Not Apply).

#### Armor Types

Armor is typically categorized as light, medium, or heavy:

- **Light Armor**: Leather, padded cloth, Kevlar vest
  - Typical Bonus: +1
- **Medium Armor**: Chainmail, scale mail, ballistic vest
  - Typical Bonus: +2
- **Heavy Armor**: Full plate, heavy powered armor, full body armor
  - Typical Bonus: +3

The GM may adjust armor Bonus values based on setting, tech level, or magical enhancement.

#### Heavy Armor Maluses

Heavy armor provides excellent protection but imposes restrictions on movement and agility:

- **Dodge Malus**: Heavy armor imposes a Malus on Dodge Feats (GM discretion, typically -1 or -2)
- **Speed and Agility Malus**: Heavy armor imposes a Malus on Feats requiring speed or agility (sprinting, acrobatics, parkour, etc.)
- **Swimming Difficulty**: Heavy armor makes swimming very difficult or impossible (GM may require Feats or declare automatic failure)

#### Situations Where Armor Does Not Apply

Armor may not provide protection in certain circumstances:

- **Unaware Targets**: When attacking an unaware or helpless target, armor may not apply if the attacker can target vulnerable spots (e.g., stabbing between armor plates, garroting, targeting gaps in protection)
- **GM Discretion**: The GM determines when armor doesn't apply based on the situation, target awareness, and attack method
- **Examples**: Sneak attacks on sleeping targets, precision strikes on armor gaps, attacks on restrained/helpless targets where armor can be bypassed

#### Modern and Science Fiction Armor

Modern and science fiction protective gear functions the same way as traditional armor:

- **Modern Armor**: Kevlar, ballistic vests, and similar modern protective gear function as armor with Bonus
  - Examples: Kevlar vest (+1), Ballistic vest (+2), Full body armor (+3)
  - Follows same rules as traditional armor (Bonus added to Defensive Feats, heavy armor Maluses, situations where armor doesn't apply, etc.)
- **Ballistic Shields**: Portable shields (riot shields, ballistic shields) provide armor protection when actively used
  - May be treated as Block Defensive Feat + Armor Bonus
  - Can be used to protect others (GM discretion)
  - When not actively held/used, does not provide protection
  - Examples: Riot shield (+1), Ballistic shield (+2)
- **Tech Level Considerations**: Higher tech levels may provide better armor protection or specialized armor types
  - Energy shields, reactive armor, nanoweave, etc. (GM determines Bonus based on tech level)
  - Sci-fi armor may have special properties (energy resistance, environmental protection, etc.)

#### Powered Armor

Powered armor systems (power suits, exoskeletons, mech suits, battle frames) are treated as vehicles, not standard armor. See the [Mounts and Vehicles](#Mounts-and-Vehicles) section for details.

- **Powered Armor as Vehicle**: Powered armor requires fuel or power source, ammunition for integrated weapons (if applicable), and maintenance like vehicles
- **Armor Function**: When powered and operational, powered armor provides armor Bonus like any other armor
  - Typically provides +3 Bonus or higher (GM discretion based on tech level)
- **Integration with Vehicle Rules**: Follows the same rules as Mounts and Vehicles:
  - Uses fuel instead of stamina
  - Refuels instead of eating
  - Has its own character sheet (optional, for complex systems)
  - Damage expressed as Wounds (Minor = cosmetic, Major = critical systems)
- **When Unpowered**: If powered armor loses power or fuel:
  - May still provide some protection (reduced Bonus, GM discretion)
  - Imposes heavy Maluses on movement and agility (may be immobile)
  - Cannot use integrated systems or weapons

#### Vehicle Armor

Vehicle armor functions identically to character armor:

- **Same Rules as Character Armor**: Vehicle armor uses the same Bonus system
- **Armor Bonus**: Vehicles with armor gain Bonus to defense against attacks
- **Armor Types**: Vehicles can have light, medium, or heavy armor (or modern equivalents)
  - Examples: Light vehicle armor (+1), Reinforced plating (+2), Heavy armor (+3)
- **Integration**: Vehicle armor Bonus is added to vehicle Defensive Feats (if vehicles can use Defensive Feats), then converted to Passive Bonus
- **Tech Level**: Higher tech vehicles may have advanced armor (energy shields, reactive plating, etc.)
- **Maintenance**: Vehicle armor can be damaged and requires repairs (like other vehicle systems)

#### Examples: Armor in Action

**Example 1: Light Armor with Defensive Feat**

Kaelion (Concept Bonus +4, Swordsman Aspect) wears light leather armor (+1 Bonus) and uses Dodge to avoid an attack.

- Active Dodge Bonus: +4 (from Swordsman Aspect)
- Armor Bonus: +1
- Total Active Bonus: +5
- Passive Bonus: round(5 / 2) = 3 successes

The attacker must roll 3 or more successes to hit Kaelion.

**Example 2: Heavy Armor with Defensive Feat**

A knight in full plate armor (+3 Bonus) with Concept Bonus +6 and a "Knight of the Realm" Aspect that applies to Block attempts to block an attack.

- Active Block Bonus: +6 (from Knight Aspect)
- Armor Bonus: +3
- Total Active Bonus: +9
- Passive Bonus: round(9 / 2) = 5 successes

The attacker must roll 5 or more successes to hit. However, if the knight tried to Dodge instead, they would receive a Malus (typically -1 or -2) due to the heavy armor.

**Example 3: Armor Against Physical Spell**

A guard in chainmail (+2 Bonus) with Concept Bonus +2 and no relevant defensive Aspects is targeted by an ice bolt spell.

- Base spell difficulty: 2 successes (Apprentice-level)
- Active Block Bonus: +0 (no relevant Aspect, uses Defensive Floor)
- Defensive Floor: round(2 / 3) = 1
- Armor Bonus: +2
- Total Active Bonus: 1 + 2 = 3
- Passive Block Bonus: round(3 / 2) = 2 successes
- Total Spell Resistance: 2 (base) + 2 (defense) = 4 successes required

The spellcaster must roll 4 or more successes for the ice bolt to hit the guard.

**Example 4: Armor Bypassed**

An assassin sneaks up on a sleeping knight in full plate armor. The assassin targets the gap between the helmet and gorget with a garrote.

- The GM rules that armor does not apply because:
  - The target is unaware and helpless
  - The attack targets a vulnerable spot between armor plates
  - The attack method (garroting) bypasses armor protection

The attack proceeds without the armor Bonus.

**Example 5: Fire Spell vs Armor**

A pyromancer casts a fireball at a warrior in full plate armor (+3 Bonus).

- The GM rules that armor provides minimal or no protection against fire
- Fire can cook someone alive inside armor, so the armor Bonus does not apply to Spell Resistance
- The warrior's Spell Resistance is calculated using only their Defensive Feat (likely Passive Dodge or Block)
- The fireball's heat may even make the armor a liability (GM discretion)

---

#### Counterspell

Spellcasters may use spells as Defensive Feats, replacing traditional defensive options such as Dodge, Block, or Parry for that beat. The spell must make narrative sense as a defensive measure. For example: a Conjurer might summon a floating shield to block a physical attack, a Pyromancer might use his control over flames to deflect an incoming fireball, or an Abjurer might weave a barrier of pure force magic around himself.

Requirements:

- The caster must have at least one Spellcasting Aspect tied to a school of magic
- The spell must be cast from within the caster's school of magic (same restrictions as normal spellcasting)
- The spell's narrative description must make sense as a defensive measure against the incoming attack
- The caster uses Counterspell instead of other Defensive Feats (Dodge, Block, Parry, etc.) for that beat

Mechanics:

When using a spell as a Defensive Feat, the caster makes a single spellcasting roll that must satisfy two conditions simultaneously:

1. Defensive Contest: The spellcasting roll must produce MORE successes than the attacker's roll (Active vs Active contest)
2. Spell Success: The spellcasting roll must meet or exceed the spell's difficulty

This is an Active Feat: Passive Bonus cannot be used when casting spells as Defensive Feats, consistent with normal spellcasting rules. The caster must roll every time.

If the spellcasting roll beats the attacker's roll but fails to meet the spell's difficulty, the defense fails because the spell fails to manifest. If the spellcasting roll meets the spell's difficulty but doesn't beat the attacker's roll, the spell manifests but the defense fails (the attack hits). Both conditions must be met for the spell to successfully defend.

Spell vs Spell:

When defending against an incoming spell with a counterspell, the resolution works as follows:

- The counterspeller's spellcasting roll is compared directly to the attacking spellcaster's roll (Active vs Active contest)
- The counterspeller must roll number of successes greater than or equal to the attacking spellcaster
- The counterspell must also meet its own difficulty to manifest, as determined by the GM

Armor and Counterspell:

When using a counterspell against a physical attack, Armor Bonus does not apply to the spellcasting roll, but it may be added on top of it, after the GM determines whether the counterspell has manifested successfully. The GM determines whether armor applies based on the nature of the attack and the failed spell.

Mana and Eldritch Burden:

Normal spellcasting rules apply when using spells as Defensive Feats:

- If they roll a Bane, the caster takes a hit from magical strain, losing 1 Mana and 1 Stamina (or 1 Wound if no Stamina remains)
- In addition, the Atomic D6 may generate special consequences (Boon, Bane, or Neutral) that affect the spell or the defense
- If the spell is maintained as an ongoing effect, Eldritch Burden rules apply

Examples:

Example 1: Conjurer vs Physical Attack

A Conjurer (Conjuration Bonus +4) is attacked by a raging barbarian wielding an axe. The Conjurer chooses to use Counterspell, summoning a floating magical shield to block the attack.

- The Conjurer describes the spell: "I conjure a floating iron shield in front of me"
- GM sets spell difficulty: 2 successes (Apprentice-level conjuration, Beat duration, close range)
- Barbarian rolls attack: 3 successes
- Conjurer rolls spellcasting (including Atomic D6): 5 successes and a Bane

Result: The Conjurer's roll (5) beats the barbarian's roll (3) AND meets the spell difficulty (2). The shield successfully manifests and blocks the attack. The Conjurer loses 1 Mana and 1 Stamina from magical strain due to the Bane. The GM may rule that the Bane generates additional consequences.

Example 2: Pyromancer vs Fireball

A Pyromancer (Pyromancy Bonus +5) is targeted by an enemy spellcaster's fireball. The Pyromancer chooses to use Counterspell to try to usurp control of the incoming spell and deflect it.

- The Pyromancer describes the spell: "I try to redirect the fireball away from me."
- GM sets spell difficulty: 3 successes (Journeyman-level pyromancy, Beat duration, close range)
- Attacking spellcaster rolls: 4 successes
- Pyromancer rolls spellcasting: 6 successes and a Boon

Result: The Pyromancer's roll (6) beats the attacking spellcaster's roll (4) AND meets the spell difficulty (3). The fireball is successfully deflected.

Example 3: Failed Defense, Successful Spell

An Abjurer (Abjuration Bonus +3) attempts to block a sword strike with a protective barrier.

- GM sets spell difficulty: 2 successes
- Attacker rolls: 5 successes
- Abjurer rolls spellcasting: 4 successes and a Bane

Result: The Abjurer's roll (4) meets the spell difficulty (2), so the barrier manifests. However, the roll (4) does not beat the attacker's roll (5), so the defense fails. The barrier appears but the sword strike still hits. The Abjurer loses 1 Mana and 1 Stamina from magical strain.

Example 4: Successful Defense, Failed Spell

A Transmuter (Transmutation Bonus +3) attempts to turn their skin into stone to block an attack.

- GM sets spell difficulty: 4 successes
- Attacker rolls: 2 successes
- Transmuter rolls spellcasting: 3 successes, Neutral Atomic D6

Result: The Transmuter's roll (3) beats the attacker's roll (2), however, the roll (3) does not meet the spell difficulty (4), so the spell fails to manifest and the Transmuter takes a hit from the attack.

### Adding Feats to the Character Sheet

Characters in Atomic D6 are allowed to attempt any Feat, not just those written down on their character sheet.

The Feat list is meant as a quick reference for the GM and the players, so that they don't have to keep pausing the game to make rulings to ascertain how many dice to roll.

For instance: After fighting bandits, Kaelion captures one alive, and he wants to question the prisoner to determine the location of their hideout.

The GM rules that this is a new Feat called "Interrogation" and grants him a Half Bonus under the rationale that a Prince would have prior experience questioning subordinates and sorting out truth from lies.

Kaelion adds Interrogation to his list of Feats, with a Half Bonus. This way he doesn't have to wait for a GM ruling every time he uses this Feat in the future.

There is no limit on the number of Feats that can be added to the Character Sheet this way.

In addition to granting characters Bonuses or Maluses, the GM can adjust Feat difficulty to account for changing conditions:

| Description:                                  | GM Difficulty Adjustment (Successes Required): |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|

Example Feats in Depth
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Untrained (1 Successes)

Feats are unreliable tricks. They reflect clumsy attempts at technique, often failing under pressure and offering little advantage.

For example:

Inventory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
Zone Movement
================================================================================
Zones are arbitrary divisions of the map defined as the distance most characters can cover by moving for one [Beat](#Time).

If they do nothing else besides move, characters may move two Zones in one [Beat](#Time).

Characters with magical or technological augmentation may move faster or slower.

If the GM is using maps, it is expected that they divide them into Zones, or otherwise enforce Zone Movement when applicable.

A Note on Differing Movement Speeds
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If all parties are roughly the same speed, the GM is encouraged to make the Zones larger. For instance, during a chase between two motorcycles, the GM might make zones that take up an entire city block so that all characters can still move roughly one zone per [Beat](#Time).

**If characters are traveling at significantly different speeds,** the GM can draw smaller zones inside the larger ones. For instance: if a character suddenly dismounts their motorcycle during the chase, the GM can quickly delineate some smaller zones inside of the larger ones.

If the GM finds themselves having to draw too large or too small, they can feel free to run the action using two different maps at different scales.

| **D8:** | **Description:** | **Equivalent to:**                                                                    |
|---------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | Instant          | An event that happens immediately.                                                    |
| 2       | Moment           | A brief but significant point in time within a Beat, often influencing its direction. |
| 3       | Beat             | A single turn within turn-based play, a part of a Scene.                              |
| 4       | Scene            | A single continuous unit of action, typically lasting for several Beats.              |

| 7       | Narrative        | A full campaign, typically spanning one to five Acts.                                 |
| 8       | Permanent        | Forever, in perpetuity.                                                               |

Flashbacks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GMs may give out Flashbacks to players that they may use later.

At any time, characters may choose to spend a Flashback in order to remember a scene that happened in the past. They might remember that they packed certain equipment or planned ahead for a specific contingency that they're facing.

Flashbacks are still full scenes that can have major consequences on the progression of the sequence. Characters must roll for any Feats that they attempt, and deduct gold for any equipment they remember purchasing.

Flashbacks are not time travel. They can add additional past events, but they cannot cancel out past events that have already happened. If characters incur damage during the flashback, it manifests in the present, or the flashback simply fails to make any effect. This is particularly true if a character dies in a flashback.

---

Mounts and Vehicles
================================================================================

Mounts and Vehicles in Atomic D6 are treated much the same way as characters.

Characters may control a Mount or Vehicle with greater or less ability, depending upon their piloting skill.

If the mount or vehicle has a mind of its own (for instance, a horse, or a spaceship with an AI computer) it is considered a full-fledged character, and it may resist the pilot or decide to ignore their commands and do something else.

The character sheet for a mount or vehicle is nearly identical to a Player's character sheet, with the exception that vehicles have fuel instead of stamina, and they refuel instead of eating.

Damage to vehicles is still expressed via wounds. In this case, Minor Wounds represent cosmetic damage, and Major Wounds represent damage to critical systems.

Fuel is usually not lost when a vehicle takes a hit in the same way that characters lose stamina when they're hit. Rather, fuel is expended by movement, and performing piloting Feats.

Mounts and vehicles that are "alive" do not require a pilot to operate on their own, but when doing so, their ability to attempt Feats may be limited.

Instead of medical care, vehicles must be repaired. The difficulty of the repair job is determined by the severity of the damage, the level of the mechanic, and how technologically advanced the vehicle is.

---

Cybernetics
================================================================================

Cybernetics are Aspects that are a part of a character's body, and they extend what characters can do.

Just like any other body part, cybernetics can be disabled by wounds.

Repairing a cybernetic implant is a complicated process requiring a Feat of "Cybernetics" performed by a skilled Cybernetician. Electronics experts and medical professionals without training in Cybernetics may attempt to heal an implant, but they receive a Half Bonus because this Feat is tangental to their area of expertise.

Just like any other Feats, Cybernetics consume Stamina, but they also require additional resources that vary depending upon the nature of the augmentation.

If the implant grants the character spellcasting abilities, it consumes Mana. In addition, some implants require an external power source. Others require fuel or ammunition. These resources are required for characters to keep their implants functioning.

It is assumed that players are recharging and refueling their cybernetics while eating and drinking. If characters lack the special resources needed to power their implants, they may regain Stamina, but their implants stop functioning.

---

Domains
================================================================================
Overview
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At higher levels of play, characters might gain control over Domains: kingdoms, factions, corporations, or empires. This system allows players to engage in large-scale politics, warfare, economics, and diplomacy while preserving Atomic D6's streamlined mechanics.

Much like Characters, each Domain has a Concept, Aspects, and Holdings that define its strengths and weaknesses. Domain Feats occur in Domain Turns, which typically represent at least one Sequence, and could possibly span months or even years.

Domain Feats are useful in order to determine how large events unfold in the background of the game, in between the player's actions. For instance: to determine whether an invasion succeeds, the attacker and defender can roll a single contest between Domain Feats.

---
Gaining Control of a Domain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Characters may assume control over a Domain in various ways, depending on the game's narrative and setting. Here are some common paths to Domain leadership:

### 1. Inheritance & Bloodlines
- A character may inherit a Domain through noble birth, royal succession, or familial legacy.
- The transition of power may be smooth or contested, requiring political maneuvering or even military force.

### 2. Military Conquest
- A Domain may be seized through force of arms, either by leading an army or orchestrating a coup.
- Conquest may lead to resistance, uprisings, or logistical challenges in maintaining control over the new territory.

### 3. Political Intrigue & Manipulation
- Characters skilled in diplomacy, espionage, or blackmail may rise to power through political games.
- Gaining favor with key factions, eliminating rivals, or forging alliances can shift the balance of power.

### 4. Religious or Ideological Authority
- A character may lead a Domain by being the head of a major faith, cult, or revolutionary movement.
- Spiritual influence or ideological fervor can unite people under a leader’s vision, granting control over a Domain.

### 5. Economic Domination
- Control over trade, resources, or financial institutions can allow a character to dominate a region.
- Merchant princes, crime lords, or industrial magnates can use wealth to buy power, fund armies, or topple rulers.

### 6. Divine or Supernatural Intervention
- A character may gain a Domain by receiving divine mandate, mystical power, or otherworldly backing.
- Gods, ancient spirits, or eldritch entities may bestow rulership upon a worthy (or cursed) individual.

### 7. Democratic or Popular Election
- In some societies, rulers are elected by councils, senates, or the will of the people.
- Winning an election or leading a popular movement can grant legitimate control over a Domain.

### 8. Founding a New Domain
- A character may carve out a new Domain in unclaimed or hostile lands.
- This could involve settling a colony, uniting scattered factions, or leading a nomadic horde to glory.

Gaining control over a Domain often comes with challenges, including rival factions, internal instability, and external threats. Players must navigate these obstacles to maintain and expand their rule.

---

Regents, Ministers, and Managers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leaders that wish to go out on adventures must leave someone in charge of their Domain. It goes without saying that this requires a great deal of trust.

During each Domain Turn, leaders may issue standing orders to their Ministers, who will (usually) execute them to the best of their ability.

If leaders are out of communication, their Ministers will follow standing orders and do their best to react to situations as they arise.

Gaining Aspects from Domains
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When a character is part of a Domain (such as a Faction, Kingdom, or Guild), they can gain an Aspect that represents their role, rank, and influence within that Domain.

These Aspects change how people react to the character. They might grant Bonuses or Maluses in relevant situations, and they might allow characters access to new resources.

| Aspect Example                    | Bonus                                  | Malus                                    |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "Knight of the Sun Court"         | when negotiating with nobility         | when dealing with criminal organizations |
| "Member of the Alchemist’s Guild" | to crafting potions                    | when bartering outside the guild         |
| "Crimson Blades Enforcer"         | to intimidation in mercenary contracts | when dealing with nobility               |

### Changing Domain Aspects
- Promotion or Demotion: Characters may gain or lose ranks within a Domain, altering their Aspects.
- Defection or Betrayal: Leaving a Domain may replace the Aspect with something negative (e.g., "Exiled from the Sun Court").
- Multiple Domain Aspects: A character may belong to multiple Domains, but they might find it increasingly difficult to manage split allegiances.

By treating Domains as living, evolving entities, these Aspects help shape how characters interact with the world and how the world reacts to them.

Progression of Domains
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Domain's Concept Bonus represents the scope of its political, social, and cultural influence.

Just like when Characters advance, when a Domain expands or contracts, the GM may call for a roll of one or more [Advancements](#Concept-Bonus-Advancement) to determine whether its Concept Bonus changes.

| Bonus | Scope of Power | Examples                                                               |
|-------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| +0    | Powerless      | Scattered unaffiliated individuals, a failed kingdom, or outlawed cult |
| +2    | Village        | A locality, minor guild, or small mercenary band                       |
| +4    | Province       | A large city or province, a city-state                                 |
| +6    | Kingdom        | A nation, a large faith, a military order                              |
| +9    | Empire         | A realm controlling multiple nations                                   |
|-------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| +14   | Planet         | A planetary empire, a world religion                                   |
| +20   | Interstellar   | An interstellar republic, a galactic megacorp                          |
| +26   | Galactic       | A civilization spanning multiple galaxies                              |

### Levels of Wealth for Domains

Wealth for Domains works differently from the way wealth works for Characters because Domains accumulate shared resources that are held in common.

It is generally assumed that Domains can afford goods and services equivalent to their Concept Bonus.

For instance: a province can afford to field a garrison of troops and build city walls. A village can afford to construct a modest guild hall. An Empire can afford multiple majestic fleets of ships.

A Domain's Wealth Level is based on its Concept Bonus and it increases or decreases via [Advancement](#Concept-Bonus-Advancement) when the Domain gains or loses wealth. Just like Characters, Domains only track significant changes in Wealth. Individual coins are not counted.

For instance: the Concept Bonus of an Empire is usually +9, but an impoverished Empire run by a corrupt leader that bankrupted their coffers may receive -2 to their Wealth Level, bringing it down to +7. When making financial decisions, leaders of such an Empire receive only +7 instead of the full +9.

A leader of a Domain may not extract personal wealth from their Domain's treasury without consequences.

| Bonus: | Domain Wealth Level | Examples of What Can Be Bought or Maintained                                                                                        |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| +0     | Powerless           | Scavenged goods, bartered favors, meager supplies, basic shelter, hand-forged tools, sustenance-level food.                         |
| +2     | Village             | Modest guild hall, palisade defenses, civilian militia, farming equipment, community storage, livestock herds.                      |
| +4     | Province            | Stone fortifications, market districts, trade caravans, blacksmith forges, garrisoned troops, public works projects.                |
| +6     | Kingdom             | Castles, temples, universities, city walls, national army or navy, minting currency, sponsoring magical research.                   |
| +9     | Empire              | Grand fleets, monumental architecture, standing professional armies, transcontinental trade routes, imperial palaces.               |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| +14    | Planet              | Planetary defense grids, orbital stations, terraforming infrastructure, global communication networks, megacities.                  |
| +20    | Interstellar        | Starfleets, interstellar colonies, Dyson swarm projects, AI governance systems, translight trade networks.                          |
| +26    | Galactic            | Galaxy-spanning megastructures, pan-galactic armadas, stellar re-engineering, multi-species civilizations, temporal infrastructure. |

Domain Turns
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Domain Turns happen in-between Sequences of player actions:

1. Players issue orders to regents, ministers and managers and narrate what their characters are planning to do while orders are being carried out.
2. Optionally, the GM may narrate additional scenes that spotlight player actions and choices during the Domain Turn
3. GM sets difficulty for Domain Feats and determines which Bonuses apply. This difficulty can be influenced by player actions and choices.
4. One of the players rolls Domain Feat Die, and the Atomic D6
5. The GM narrates the outcome at a high level and determines how many Character and Domain resources were consumed

Domain Feats vs. Individual Feats
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Domain Feats require characters to issue orders to the members of their organization. Giving orders is not always easy; it can be a feat of communication and diplomacy in and of itself.

After the regent, minister, or manager of the domain receives the orders, they (usually) execute them to the best of their ability. They pass orders to their subordinates, and the Domain Feat is executed.

Domain Feats are resolved in the same manner as Character Feats, by looking at Domain Aspects to determine relevant Bonuses and Maluses and rolling Feat Die accordingly.

Example Domain Feats by Successes Required
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Powerless (0 Successes)

Feats are unreliable or impossible. The collective lacks organization and cannot act meaningfully at scale.

- Struggle to provide food and shelter.
- Vulnerable to outside threats without coordination.
- Cannot build or defend infrastructure reliably.
- Survival depends on luck or outside aid.

#### Village (1 Success)

    Feats are simple, functional collective efforts. They work reliably in straightforward conditions but break down under large-scale stress.

- Feed and shelter a small population.
- Defend against bandits or wild beasts.
- Build basic fortifications (palisades, watchtowers).
- Craft simple weapons and tools for survival.
- Organize hunting, farming, or herding at subsistence levels.

- Wage wars across borders.
- Establish cities, universities, and guilds.
- Shape culture, laws, and religious movements.
- Build wonders of the world (cathedrals, castles, colossal statues).
- Develop bureaucracies to manage large populations.

#### Empire (5 Successes)

Feats are mythic acts of mastery at the civilizational scale. They bend probability and momentum in favor of an entire people.

- Conquer and integrate diverse cultures.
- Control trade and communication across continents.
- Build vast navies or armies with near-limitless reach.
- Shape religions or ideologies to unify millions.
- Construct early megastructures (Great Walls, sprawling aqueduct systems).

#### Planet (7 Successes)

Feats are world-shaping acts. They alter environments, ecosystems, and societies permanently.

- Terraform regions to suit needs.
- Mobilize billions for planetary projects.
- Establish orbital defenses and interplanetary reach.
- Harness planetary-scale energy sources (fusion grids, massive reactors).
- Build structures visible from space (orbital elevators, supercities).

#### Interstellar (10 Successes)

Feats extend across solar systems. They overwhelm barriers that would stop any lesser collective.

- Colonize multiple star systems.
- Build fleets capable of interstellar dominance.

Crafting and Technology
================================================================================

All items in Atomic D6 can be crafted
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any item in Atomic D6 can be crafted. The difficulty of a crafting feat depends on several factors:
- Aspect Bonus of the craftsman
- Tech. Level (TL) of the craftsman
- TL and quality of the craftsman's tools
- TL of the item being crafted
- Intrinsic complexity of the item being crafted

Technology is Cultural
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technology level is a cultural shorthand rather than a universal law.

Different societies can have members from different TLs and cultures simultaneously. For instance: on Earth, individuals from post-industrial societies coexist with those from hunter-gatherer societies.

TL represents the advancement of tools, knowledge, and infrastructure available to a craftsman.

Different worlds may develop along different paths with TLs. For instance: a civilization might enter modernity on a world where fossil fuels don't exist.

GMs are encouraged to tweak or reinterpret TLs depending on their campaign setting.

Crafting Costs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Man hours
- Components
- Beats

Large Projects
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Example: Castles, Starships, Dyson Spheres
- Can require multiple Domain Feats to craft
- Can require thousands or millions of man hours
- Each Feat might span hours, years, or millennia, depending on the subjective scope of the Narrative
- Each Feat requires a roll of the Atomic D6

Technological Distance Makes Crafting Harder
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some items are so distant from the craftsman's TL that they are difficult to make.

For instance: a modern human might struggle to knap flint, his ancestors having lost the art long ago. Conversely, he might struggle while trying to craft a faster-than-light drive because his grasp of the technology is so simplistic that it is indistinguishable from magic for him.

In both situations, characters receive a Malus to crafting the item.


Tech. Levels of Civilizations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TL 0 - Stone Age (Prehistoric Survivalists)

- Power is measured in physical prowess, survival skills, and oral traditions.

---

### Types of Fallen Civilizations

- F1 - Cataclysmic Collapse: Civilization destroys itself through war, AI rebellion, or resource depletion.
- F2 - Stagnation: Civilization becomes complacent, reaching a plateau and ceasing to innovate.
- F3 - Technological Regression: Civilization loses advanced knowledge due to economic collapse, war, or cultural rejection.
- F4 - Cosmic Extinction: Civilization falls due to external cosmic events (black hole drift, alien invasion, or planetary-scale disasters).
- F5 - Digital Ascension: Civilization uploads its consciousness into virtual reality, abandoning physical existence and appearing "extinct."

---

### Different Paths for AI-Integrated Civilizations (T6 - T8)

- AI1 - Synthetic Ascension (AI Supremacy): AI fully replaces biological life and governs civilization autonomously.
- AI2 - Hybrid Civilization (AI-Organic Merge): AI and organic life permanently integrate, creating a post-biological superintelligence.
- AI3 - AI Collapse (Runaway Intelligence): AI expands unchecked, consuming all resources or turning against its creators.
- AI4 - AI as a Tool (Benevolent AI Governance): AI serves as a perfect steward, guiding civilizations without eliminating free will.
- AI5 - AI Dystopia (Digital Slavery): AI dominates, controlling every aspect of life, leaving biological beings as second-class citizens.

---

### Potential Conflicts for T8+ Civilizations

Sometimes it can be difficult for the GM to imagine what might possibly cause divine beings to come into conflict. These suggestions can be a jumping-off point.

#### 1. Reality Wars (Conflicts Over the Nature of Existence)

- Some factions want to preserve the base reality, while others seek to collapse all matter into simulation.
- Battle between those who see physical existence as obsolete and those who still value it.

#### 2. The Collapse vs. Expansion Dilemma

- Expansionalists believe in constant growth and colonization.
- Minimalists advocate for civilizations to compress into higher-dimensional micro-realities.

#### 3. Time War (Manipulation of Causality & Multiverses)

- Preservers want a stable, linear timeline.
- Revisionists rewrite history for an optimized outcome.
- Anarchists create infinite branching realities.

#### 4. The Energy War (Battles Over Universal Entropy & Star Harvesting)

- Stellar Conservators oppose large-scale star draining.
- Dyson Imperium pushes for full energy utilization.
- Entropy Cults seek to accelerate the heat death of the universe.

#### 5. Post-Mortality Conflict (Death vs. Immortality)

Worldbuilding Through High-Level Play
================================================================================

In Atomic D6, the campaign world is not static: it is a Narrative, just like the events unfolding in play. Instead of starting with a pre-built setting, players can create the world dynamically by taking on the roles of divine beings, primordial forces, or legendary founders. Through Domain Level Play, they may shape history, establish civilizations, and define the world's fundamental laws, all while telling an evolving story.

---

Playing as an Elder Deity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_"That is not dead which can eternal lie... and with strange aeons even death may die."_ - H.P. Lovecraft

Elder Deities take turns called Primordial Aeons.

In the Primordial Aeons, the Elder Deities can create or modify any one of the Atomic Elements:

- Cosmology
  - Natural and Magical Laws
  - Lesser Deities
- Planetology
- Geography
- Species
- History and Prehistory:
    - Domains
        - Cultures
        - Nations
        - Factions
        - Religions
    - Characters
        - Motivations
        - Conflicts
    - Periods
    - Events

Elder Deities can add Atomic Elements to the beginning, middle, or end of history at any time during the Primordial Aeons.

Atomic Elements cannot be removed from the game once they are introduced, however, they can be killed or destroyed by historical events introduced later.

---

Game Setting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When they reach a consensus, or a predetermined number of Primordial Aeons, the Elder Deities may decide to begin the next phase of the game.

Based on the setting that they created, the Elder Deities work with the players in order to determine the time period and location of the beginning of the game.

After that, players will need to work with the GM to determine their starting Concept Bonus, and create characters with Concepts rooted in the setting that they created.

---

Playing as Multiple Characters
================================================================================

With GM permission, a player may control more than one character simultaneously, such as a wizard and their fighter bodyguard.

Rules for Multiple Characters:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Distinct Roles: Each character should have a unique function in the party to prevent redundancy.
- Balanced Spotlight: The GM should ensure that a single player does not dominate the game, allowing all players equal engagement.
- Action Economy: When controlling multiple characters, a player must manage their actions fairly, ensuring each character follows initiative order appropriately.
- Character Cohesion: If playing multiple characters, they should have a reason to work together, whether through bonds, employment, or shared goals.
- GM Discretion: The GM may impose limits, such as preventing players from running more than two characters at once or restricting additional characters to support roles.

This rule allows for more flexible storytelling and party compositions, ensuring each player can contribute to the game in a meaningful way.

---

Solo Play
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In some cases, a player may wish to take on the role of both the player and the GM, running an entire game by themselves. This allows for personalized storytelling, experimentation, and world-building.

- Structured Improvisation: Since the player is also the GM, they should establish loose guidelines and tools (random tables, oracle decks, or AI-assisted prompts) to generate unexpected challenges.
- Self-Limiting Mechanics: To maintain balance, the player should follow standard rules for action economy, combat, and skill checks without favoring their character.
- Journaling & Logs: Keeping a session journal helps track progress, world changes, and character development.
- Randomization & Uncertainty: Using dice rolls or external resources (such as solo RPG engines) can prevent predictable outcomes and keep the game engaging.

Solo play provides a way for players to explore narratives at their own pace, experiment with world-building, and refine gameplay mechanics without needing a traditional group setup.
