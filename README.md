Atomic D20 takes its inspiration from too many sources and individuals to name, including, but not limited to: FATE Condensed, FUDGE 10th Anniversary Edition, EZD6, and Mini Six.

# Why is this game called Atomic D20?

The Atom is the smallest stable unit found in nature. Despite its small size, it contains a great deal of potential energy, and it can be combined into a multitude of different forms. In that sense, this game seeks to embody the qualities of its namesake.

# The Five Mutually Reenforcing Design Principles of Atomic D20

Fun
---
Above all else, we will strive to make our rules fun, even at the expense of our other principles.

Speed
-----
A faster game is an exciting game, and exciting games are fun.

Simplicity
----------
We will strive to do more with less, which will make our game faster to understand and play.

Extensibility
-------------
We will prefer open-ended rules that can be extended by players and the community, which will help us do more with less.

Scalability
-----------
We will prefer rules that can handle a wide range of power levels and situations consistently, which will help keep things simple.

# Maneuvers

As a general rule, any character may attempt to do anything.

By default, a character rolls as Untrained (+0)

A character's High Concept, Lineage, and Expertise each grant bonuses if they are relevant to the maneuver that the character is attempting.

## Practiced vs. Spontaneous Maneuvers

Once per day, characters may spend an hour during one of their rests practicing maneuvers. No more than five maneuvers may be practiced in this way.

Maneuvers practiced this way may be rolled with a large boon (+2) in addition to any other bonuses that they would ordinarily receive.

If characters wish to modify a maneuver and execute it with a slight difference from the way it was practiced, they receive a small boon (+1) instead of a large one.

# TODO Spellcasting

Spells are a particular kind of maneuver which involve bending the rules of the universe itself.

Spellburn
-----------
Bending the rules of the universe to one's will is not without its cost. Spells differ from other maneuvers in that when a spell fails, the caster loses some of their life force. Players take severe (2d6) damage each time a spell fails.

TODO: Spellburn only on failure, or on every cast?

Paradox
---------
Magic is still mysterious and poorly understood. It has been observed that occasionally, the same exact spell will get more difficult when cast repeatedly.  Other spells that seem to break the laws and expectations of the universe also experience this phenomenon.

Wizards who have experienced this describe it as the universe exerting its own will and pushing back against a paradoxical situation that should not be happening.

## Spell Failures

### Critical Failures:
D6:     Description:
--------------------
1:      Invert target: beneficial spell cast on a foe, harmful spell now targets a friend.
2:      Invert effect: Spell has the opposite effect from what was intended
3:      Random effect: Spell now has a random effect on its intended target
4:      Random target
5:      Miraculous recovery: Spell works as intended!

# Health and Wounds

Characters have three kinds of health on their sheet. Stamina is represented by a pair of lungs. The state of a character's body is represented by hearts, and their mental state is represented by brains.

Most humanoids have one unit of Stamina, three units of physical health, and three units of mental health, but this is not necessarily always true. 

Stamina is special because it can be consumed in place of a minor physical or mental wound. Consuming Stamina in this way represents a character expending their energy to take evasive action. In addition, some actions like sprinting or concentrating for a long period of time are particularly taxing and they may also consume a character's Stamina.

Minor Wounds
------------
If 9 damage or less is inflicted upon a character, they receive a Minor Wound. Minor physical wounds represent cuts and bruises, and they consume one Heart or Stamina.

Minor mental wounds represent things like anxiety, depression, and trauma, and they consume one Brain or Stamina.

A Minor Wound in a particularly annoying place might incur a temporary Bane upon the character whenever they attempt to use that body part.

Major Wounds
------------
When a character takes 10 or more damage, they receive a Major Wound. Major wounds consume two units of physical or mental health and they always incur a Bane.

Major Wounds may be permanent, or they may take as few as 7 days to heal. A particularly bad wound like an amputated limb might even render the affected body part completely nonfunctional.

When all of a character's Hearts are consumed, they begin to die (see the corresponding section on Death for more details)

When all of a character's Brains are consumed, their personality is permanently destroyed, and they become catatonic.

Nonlethal Damage
----------------
Characters may choose to specify that they are attempting to deal nonlethal damage. At that point, their target becomes unconscious instead of dying when all of their Hearts or Brains are consumed. Attacks with firearms and certain spells cannot be made nonlethal, but most blunt melee attacks can.

Wound Locations
---------------
Physical wounds are localized to specific parts of a character's anatomy. If a character receives one as the result of an attack or failed maneuver, the DM may use the result of that roll in order to determine its location:
```
D20 result:     Wound Location:
===============================
20              Head
19              Neck
18              Upper Torso
17              Lower Torso
15-16           Groin
13-14           Right Arm
11-12           Left Arm
10              Right Hand
9               Left Hand
8               Right Leg
7               Left Leg
6               Right Foot
5               Left Foot
3-4             Right Shoulder
1-2             Left Shoulder
```
# Healing

A character's Stamina recovers after a half hour rest without strenuous activity.

For each Minor Wound that they have, Characters may roll D20 when they wake up each morning. If they roll 8 or more, the wound is healed. The second day, the DC is 6.  On the third day, the DC is 4.

Characters must wait until the morning of the seventh day in order to roll to heal a Major Wound. The DC to heal a Major wound is 14. At the DM's discretion, even after they heal, some Major Wounds inflict permanent changes.

TODO How does magical / alchemical healing work?

# Death:

When all of a character's wound slots are filled, they begin to die, and they may choose how to spend their last breaths:

Inspiring last words:
---------------------
You are mortally wounded, but your death need not be in vain. You use your last burst of energy to utter rousing last words which grant all allies within hearing distance a boon which they may use however they wish within the next ten minutes.

Adrenaline:
-----------
You take your last breaths and adrenaline keeps you functioning and grants you a boon to use however you want before you die. In addition, you take an extra turn right at this moment. At the end of that turn, you die.

Miraculous Recovery:
--------------------
You become incapacitated and focus all your energy on staying alive. Roll d20 this turn and on each subsequent turn until you die or return to consciousness:
```
D20     Result
==============
19-20:  Against all odds, you open your eyes and become conscious again
11-18:  Survive for another turn
1-10:    Slip into the abyss and die
```

# Defense and Armor Paradigms

Subtraction
-----------
* Stays constant and eventually gets rendered irrelevant because player defensive skill is much higher.
more HP
+ Automatically separates flat-footed AC from reflex because they use different mechanics

Harder to hit (+ modifier to all defensive rolls)
-------------------------------------------------
+ Tried and true
+ Simplest system
- flat-footed AC - only armor - unaware target
- Touch AC - only reflex - Spell Save
- Regular AC - Reflex + Armor

More HP
-------
* This is almost the same as subtraction
- Cannot be dynamically adjusted with Maneuvers

Additional Armor Save
---------------------
- just add to defense roll, it's quicker and easier.

Other factors to consider:
* Mobility / Evasion
* Reduce Stamina

Parry
Block - Requires shield
Dodge
Riposte
Q: Can you have Armor Skill?
Q: Should Armor Scale?
What about the disadvantages of armor? Those should also scale.
A: That's why we deal with Boons and Banes instead of raw numbers. Boons and Banes scale, and raw numbers don't.

Heavy Armor:
Medium Armor:
Light Armor:
Unarmored:

Maybe armor and items shouldn't scale? In this paradigm, players would be forced to craft items and go out into the world to find them.

Nevertheless, the effect remains the same. In that case, the armor scales up and the player does not.

Apprentice crafted Heavy Armor receives an Apprentice level Major Boon to defense. It also provides an Apprentice level Major Bane to Spellcasting and Stealth.

Done deal.

Penalties for Heavier Armor
---------------------------
- Heavier armor has a higher chance of causing a Spell Failure.
- Heavier armor gives penalties to sneaking
- Penalties to stamina

Q: Should Boons be able to be stacked, or should they cap off at Major?

Items complicate character scaling tremendously by stacking Boons.

Consider: Players are always going to find ways to stack bonuses and break the system. The parties that want to do that will gravitate to that sort of behavior. Don't worry about it. Instead, just make sure there is no single dominant strategy and the system scales gracefully.
