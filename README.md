Rules at a Glance
========================

Character Concept
---------------------

Character Concept encapsulates the core of a character's persona and determines which Aspects they're allowed to choose.

Concept is always accompanied by a number in parenthesis called Concept Bonus, which indicates the scope and scale of a Character's power.

Aspects
--------

Characters in Atomic D6 have a list of points that describe them that are called Aspects.

Aspects allow characters to apply their Concept Bonus to Feats that they are attempting.

If an Aspect ceases to be true, or if the Character Concept no longer has it, it is removed from their sheet.

An Aspect can provide Bonuses in some situations and Maluses in others. For instance: a slashed arm might grant a character a Malus on any actions using that limb, but it might grant them a Bonus when negotiating the price of a healing potion with a friendly shopkeeper.

It is recommended that GMs limit Characters to five Aspects or fewer at creation time, but they may gain more throughout the course of the Narrative.

### Species

In some settings, the GM can allow players to choose their Species. For game balance, players must work with the GM to make sure that their chosen Species has at least one significant Malus for each Bonus that it receives.

### Fighting Style

It is recommended that each character should choose at least one specific combat related Aspect, and not more than two, which describes how they fight.

### Jack of all trades, master of none

The GM is expected to make sure that Aspects are specific enough that they do not apply too many different Feats. The GM has the right to knock Aspects like this down to a Half Concept Bonus if they're too broad.

In game terms, this represents characters dabbling across a broad group of Feats without developing mastery of any of them.

### Additional Requirements

Different tables may come to a consensus regarding what kind and how many Aspects are allowed. It is recommended that players generate characters together, at the same time, in order to make sure they're thematically and mechanically aligned.

Feat Die
----------

Characters roll a number of Feat Die equal to their Concept Bonus when attempting a Feat that directly benefits from one of their Aspects.

For example: “Swordsman” allows a Character to apply their Concept Bonus to all combat Feats with a Sword.

At the highest levels of Atomic D6, characters may receive Bonuses of +10 or higher. It is not recommended for players to roll more than 10 Feat Die at a time. In these situations, characters should convert die to a flat modifier.

For instance: a character with +13 would roll 10 Feat Die, and add +3

Characters always roll at least 1 Feat Die, even when their Maluses end up being greater than all of their Bonuses.

| Feat Dice Result: | Description:  |
|-------------------|---------------|
| 1-3               | Failure       |
| 4-5               | Success       |
| 6                 | Two successes |

Feat Bonuses Summarized:
------------------------------

The rules to resolve Feats in Atomic D6 may seem overwhelming at first, but there are only three numbers that characters actually need to remember:

| Feat relationship to Aspect:                 | Calculation (rounded): |
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Directly related                             | Full Concept Bonus     |
| Directly related but also subject to a Malus | 1/2 Concept Bonus      |
| Tangentially related                         | 1/2 Concept Bonus      |
| Tangentially related and subject to a Malus  | 1/3 Concept Bonus      |
| Not related                                  | 1/3 Concept Bonus      |
| Not related and subject to a Malus           | 1/3 Concept Bonus      |

Atomic D6
-----------

The Atomic D6 is rolled whenever characters attempt a Feat. It represents narrative circumstances outside of their control that are independent of the success or failure of the Feat.

| Atomic D6 Result: | Description:                 |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| 1-2               | Bane: a negative story beat. |
| 3-4               | Neutral                      |
| 5-6               | Boon: a positive story beat. |

Half Bonus (Tangential Feats)
------------------------------------

If a character attempts a Feat that is only tangentially related to their Aspects, they may receive only a Half Bonus.

```
Half Bonus = round( Concept Bonus / 2)
```

Maluses
---------

An Aspect that hinders a character is called a Malus.

Characters subject to a Malus receive only a Half Bonus to Aspects that are affected by the Malus.

If the Feat that they are attempting is already tangental and also subject to a Malus, their Bonus is further reduced to 1/3, rounded.

For instance: because of his slashed arm, Kaelion receives a Malus to Swordsmanship, and he only gets a 1/2 Bonus to it until his arm heals.

Small Bonuses and Maluses
-------------------------------

The GM can grant Small Bonuses to represent minor advantages such as a freshly sharpened blade.

Granting players "a pip" (.1) allows them to turn a single dice into a higher number, which could be enough to turn failure into success in certain situations.

For instance, with +.1 a player could turn a 3 into a 4. With +.2 they could turn a 2 into a 4.

Players cannot have +.3 or higher. In these cases, each group of .3 is converted into a full dice (+1)

For instance: Kaelion has accumulated a bunch of minor bonuses to Swordsmanship equivalent to +.4. He converts them to full dice, and on his character sheet he writes +1.1

Passive Bonus
----------------

To reduce unnecessary rolling, the GM may ask players to convert their Aspect Bonus into an average number of automatic successes.

```
Passive Concept Bonus = round( Concept Bonus / 2 )
```

For example: a Concept Bonus of 4 / 2 rounded up = 2 automatic successes without rolling.

Passive Bonus is also used to determine how difficult it is to hit a character when they are defending.

Passive Bonus can also be used by the GM to resolve contests without the player's knowledge.

For instance: Kaelion walks down the King's Road, past some brigands hiding behind trees, waiting in ambush. The GM doesn't want to give away the situation, so instead of asking Kaelion to roll Notice, he can roll a Feat of Stealth for the Brigands and compare their result to Kaelion's Passive Bonus to Notice them.

Floor for Defensive Feats
-------------------------------

To prevent automatic failure, all characters have a floor for Defensive Feats in particular.

```
Defensive Floor = round( Concept Bonus / 3 )
```

This floor is applied when a character is forced to use a Defensive Feat that does not benefit from any of their Aspects.

Contests
----------

There are three ways to resolve Feats that involve Characters, Groups, or Domains directly opposing one another:

**Active vs Active:** both sides roll their dice; higher number of successes wins.

**Active vs Passive:** one side rolls; the other uses their Passive Bonus.

**Passive vs Passive:** compare Passive Bonuses; higher total wins.

The GM may choose from these methods to determine how Feats are resolved.

Group Feats
--------------

When two or more characters work together to perform a feat, if the majority succeed, the group succeeds.

To calculate the Passive Bonus for a group, use the average Passive Bonus of all members.

The GM has the option to add or subtract a Bonus that scales to account for differences in difficulty caused by group size:
- A small group may receive +2 for Stealth, and -2 in combat against a larger group.
- If the groups are vastly outmatched in size, the GM can declare an automatic success or failure

Domain Feats
---------------

At a certain size, resolving Group Feats begins to become unwieldy, and something more is needed.

Domains represent large groups that work together to perform Feats as a single unit.

Domains have a Concept and Aspects, and they function almost like Characters, but on a much grander scale.

The section on [Domains](#Domains) has more information.

Feats of Magic
-----------------

### Spellcasting Aspects

Characters require at least one Spellcasting Aspect in order to cast spells.

Every Spellcasting Aspect must be tied to a school of magic, which defines the limits of a character's abilities.

Spellcasting Aspects may be granted by:

- the Domain of a Divine Patron (such as a God or Goddess)
- the academic study of a magical discipline (such as Pyromancy, Necromancy, or Illusion)
- inborn capabilities, accidents, or mutations
- cybernetic enhancements
- something else (be creative)

### Mana And Magical Strain

Characters with at least one Spellcasting Aspect have a mana pool. Mana represents how much magical strain a character can safely absorb during a Sequence. By default, each spellcaster has 3 mana at the start of each Sequence.

Some say that Mana is subject to the whims of the gods. It only refreshes when a new Sequence begins. It is not restored by eating, drinking, sleeping, or the passage of in-world time.

Magical strain may represent backlash, fatigue, and psychic stress caused by magic as it bends the fabric of reality.

### Casting a Spell

1. Declare Intent: The player announces that their character is attempting to cast a spell.
2. Describe the Spell: The player describes the effect in narrative terms.
3. GM Sets Difficulty: The GM determines the base difficulty for the spell.

   - Players are encouraged to build a grimoire of frequently used spells with their base difficulties written down.
   - The GM may modify the base difficulty depending upon situational Aspects (for example: target armor, magical wards, trying to be stealthy).
   - The GM should reward players for writing down spells by granting Small Bonuses for preparedness.

4. Roll Feat Dice + Atomic D6:

   - Roll as if casting were a Feat, applying the Spellcasting Aspect and any other Bonuses.
   - The Atomic D6 may generate special consequences.
   - Passive scores may not be used when casting spells: players must roll every time.

### Spellcasting Outcomes

- Success: The spell is cast as intended.
- Failure: The spell fizzles and does not manifest.
- Boon:
  - The spell might be unexpectedly more powerful or produce an unexpected beneficial effect.
  - Spells that are unexpectedly more powerful may also be dangerous to the player and their allies!
- Bane:
  - The caster takes a hit from magical strain, and loses 1 Mana and 1 Stamina, regardless of the success or failure of the spell.
  - Just like any other hit, if the character has no Stamina remaining, they suffer 1 Wound instead.
  - The spell may have unexpected negative effects.

### Eldritch Burden

Characters may maintain one single conjured magical effect for extended periods of time.

Channeling powerful eldritch energies in this way causes visible effects. For instance: a pyromancer concentrating to maintain a spell might sprout magical flames from their eyes that grow higher depending on the power of the spell.

As long as a character is concentrating in this way, they cannot rest and recover Stamina or Wounds.

They may cast additional spells as long as they do not maintain effects over an extended period of time.

### Death by Magical Strain

When a character dies as a result of magical strain, powerful eldritch energies are released. The exact kind of eldritch energies varies depending upon the type of spell being cast, but the results are unpredictable and spectacular. For instance: a pyromancer might explode in a violent fireball.

### Paradox

Magic is bound by the rules of the world. Characters who attempt to repeatedly bend or break those rules begin to strain the fabric of reality itself.

On rare occasions, bending the rules of reality in this way can cause Paradox, which makes subsequent castings of the same world-breaking spell increasingly difficult.

Some say that Paradox is caused by gods that wish to punish mortals for breaking the rules of the reality that they constructed. Others claim it is caused by reality itself pushing back against the caster. In any case, it can have narrative as well as mechanical consequences.

Resisting a Spell
---------------------

When a spell targets a resisting character, treat their defenses as an extra layer of difficulty rather than a separate roll.

```
Spell Resistance = Base Spell Difficulty + Target’s Defensive Feat (Can be Passive or Active)
```

- The defender gets to choose which defensive Feat to use, as long as it's appropriate
  - Physical targeting: Passive Dodge, Passive Block, Passive Endure, or similar
  - Mental or sensory effects: Passive Resolve, or similar.
  - If the spell is a physical attack, armor needs
  - If the target lacks a relevant Aspect for that defense, use the standard Defensive Floor in place of their full Concept Bonus.

The caster rolls spellcasting as a normal Feat, applying their Spellcasting Aspect and other Bonuses. They must meet or beat the total Spell Resistance for the spell to fully take hold.

#### Example: Illusory Chains

A spellcaster with Illusion Bonus 3 casts an Apprentice‑level illusion to conjure chains that bind a thug’s arms and legs.
- Base spell difficulty (Apprentice effect): 2 successes.
- Thug’s Passive Dodge 1 adds +1 success.
- Total Spell Resistance: 3 successes required.

If the caster rolls 3 or more successes, the thug is fully immobilized by the illusion.

#### Spell Effects as Temporary Aspects

Spell effects such as chains, webs, or shackles are treated as a negative Aspect affecting the target (for example, “Entangled by Illusory Chains”).

- The Condition lasts while:
  - The caster maintains it as an ongoing conjured effect (subject to the existing concentration rules and Eldritch Burden), or
  - Any fixed, agreed‑upon duration expires (for non‑maintained effects).
  - While the Condition is active, the target is restricted according to the spell’s description.

#### Attempting to Break Free Each Turn

A character affected by a spell in combat may attempt to break free once each Beat as an Active Feat.

- Choose a Feat that matches the nature of the spell:
  - Physical bindings (chains, webs, snares):
    - Endure, Melee, or a custom Feat such as Break Free / Athletics.
  - Illusory / mental bindings (pure mind tricks, fear, phantasms):
    - Resolve or a similar mental defense Feat.
  - Projectiles and conjured melee attacks
    - Dodge or Block
- Apply Aspects normally; tangential Aspects grant Half Bonus, Maluses reduce effectiveness as usual.

##### Escape Difficulty

Set the difficulty to escape as:

```
Escape Difficulty = Original Spell Difficulty + Caster’s Passive Spellcasting Bonus
```

- Original Spell Difficulty is the same number the GM used when the spell was cast (for example, 2 for an Apprentice‑level effect).
- The caster’s Passive Spellcasting Bonus is their spellcasting Concept Bonus converted to a Passive Bonus (round Concept Bonus ÷ 2, as with other Passive scores).

The bound character rolls once per turn. Meeting or beating the Escape Difficulty fully ends the Condition.

Understanding Parts of the Atomic D6 Character Sheet
======================================================================
Stamina
--------
When a character takes damage, they lose Stamina. Consuming Stamina in this way represents a character getting the wind knocked out of them, or expending their energy to take evasive action.

At the GM's discretion, some actions like sprinting or concentrating for a long period of time are particularly taxing and may also consume Stamina.

If the character has no more Stamina at the time they take damage, they receive a Wound.

Wounds
-------
"It's just a flesh wound." - _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_

Wounds are Maluses that represent mental or physical damage to a character.

When characters take damage, they have to spend a point of Stamina, otherwise they are required to take a Wound.

Most heroes can sustain two Minor Wounds and one Major Wound. After that, if they get hit again, they begin to die.

#### Minor Wounds

Mild inconveniences that cause pain, distraction, and social issues. Recoverable within a matter of days. For instance:

- scratches
- grazes
- bruises
- first degree burns
- the shakes
- anxiety
- self-doubt

#### Major Wounds

Major Wounds are serious injuries which may have permanent consequences. They require specialized treatment, and even then, recovery may take weeks or months.

Some examples of Major Wounds are:
- Lacerations
- Sprains
- dislocations
- second and third degree burns
- concussions
- brain damage
- permanent psychological problems.
- broken bones
- amputations
- arterial bleeding

Characters may annotate their wound with the phrase (in treatment) after they have received aid. After the period of treatment is over, depending upon the quality of care that they received, Major Wounds can eventually be downgraded to a Minor Wound and heal naturally.

Even after healing, Major wounds can leave behind conditions that linger on. After the wound has healed, those conditions are added to a character's list of Aspects.

#### Conditions

Conditions can include:
- Knocked prone
- Unconscious
- Illness
- Starvation
- Thirst
- Poisoning
- Weakness
- Magical Curses
- Paralysis
- Amputation

These are added to Character's lists of Aspects while they are in effect.

#### Getting knocked out of the fight

Suffering the Death of a character or a permanent debilitating injury is not fun, but without consequences, player choices become meaningless.

Players should not be forced to play a character that they consider "unplayable."

In this case, they should work with the GM to roll a new character and cycle them into the Narrative. If their character was injured, they might be able to return after taking some downtime receiving treatment.

#### Eating and Drinking

Once every five hours, characters can recover Stamina naturally by taking 30 minutes of light activity to eat and drink.

Recovering Stamina in this way is a Feat with a difficulty of 1, but low quality rations make recovery more difficult.

When eating and drinking, players may roll once per point of stamina that they are attempting to recover.

It is not recommended for GMs to allow players to add their Concept Bonus to Feats of healing and Stamina recovery.

#### Sleeping
Wounds have a chance to heal naturally after characters have slept for eight hours.

Recovering from a Minor Wound by sleeping is a Feat with a difficulty of 2.

Upon waking, characters may roll once per Wound in order to determine if they have healed.

Certain species like robots do not eat, sleep, or drink, but they do require maintenance, and they have their own rules around stamina recovery.

Death
------
"It is not death a man should fear, but rather, never beginning to live" - *Marcus Aurelius*

When a character takes damage and all of their Stamina and Wounds have already been consumed, they begin to die, and they may choose how to spend their last breaths:

#### Inspiring last words

You are mortally wounded, but your death need not be in vain. You use your last breaths to utter rousing last words which grant all allies within hearing distance a Bonus that they may use within the next Sequence.

#### Adrenaline

You take your last breaths and adrenaline keeps you functioning and grants you a Bonus to use however you want. In addition, you take an extra turn right at this moment. At the end of that turn, you die, regardless of any healing you receive.

#### Critical Condition

You become incapacitated and focus all your energy on staying alive. Roll D6 at this moment, and at the beginning of each subsequent turn until you die or return to consciousness:

| D6:  | Result:                                                                      |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-3: | Slip into the abyss and die.                                                 |

If characters receive prompt medical attention, they may receive Bonuses to these rolls.

##### Death by Mental Wounds

_"some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age."_ - H.P. Lovecraft

In Atomic D6, Mental Wounds are considered to be just as deadly as physical ones. When a character dies due to Mental Wounds, their body remains in tact, but their personality is destroyed by the gravity of the cosmic horrors that they have witnessed. They are unresponsive, unable even to eat or drink, and nothing short of a magical or technological miracle can bring them back.

Character Progression
--------------------------

### Concept Bonus

A character's Concept Bonus represents the scope and scale of their power.

| Description: | Concept Bonus: |
|--------------|----------------|
| Untrained    | +0             |
| Apprentice   | +2             |
| Journeyman   | +4             |
| Master       | +6             |
| Olympian     | +9             |
|--------------|----------------|
| Demigod      | +14            |
| Lesser Deity | +20            |
| Elder Deity  | +26            |

### Concept Bonus Advancement

When players learn, either through experience, or training, the GM can award them one or more advancements to their Concept Bonus.

For each advancement granted by the GM, it is recommended that the party should roll once for the entire group so that all characters improve at the same pace.

#### Small Advancement:

| D6: | Improvement to Concept Bonus |
|-----|------------------------------|
| 1-3 | +0                           |
| 4-5 | +.1                          |
| 6   | +.2                          |

#### Large Advancement:

| D6: | Improvement to Concept Bonus |
|-----|------------------------------|
| 1-3 | +0                           |
| 4-5 | +1                           |
| 6   | +2                           |

---

Wealth
------

### Wealth Levels for Individuals

Individual coins are never tracked in Atomic D6. When Characters gain or lose a significant amount of Wealth, the GM can award them an [Advancement](#Concept-Bonus-Advancement) to determine how much their Wealth Level increases or decreases.

| Bonus | Wealth Level                              | Examples of What Can Be Afforded                                                                                           |
|-------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| +0    | Penniless                                 | Food scraps, patched clothes, makeshift shelter, improvised weapons.                                                       |
| +2    | Working-Class                             | Rent a room at an inn, buy travel gear, maintain a horse, or replace simple weapons.                                       |
| +4    | Professional / Tradesperson               | Own a small home or workshop, employ a few workers, purchase fine arms or armor.                                           |
| +6    | Noble / Merchant Lord                     | Own estates, ships, caravans, or businesses; employ guards; fund small expeditions.                                        |
| +9    | Magnate / Ruler of Fortune                | Maintain multiple estates, private armies, trade fleets, magical research, or political campaigns.                         |
|-------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| +14   | Planetary Tycoon / Corporate Sovereign    | Control banks, megacities, or world-spanning industries; finance wars or planetary terraforming.                           |
| +20   | Interstellar Mogul                        | Build fleets, colonize worlds, monopolize stellar trade, or purchase entire moons.                                         |
| +26   | Galactic Financier / Post-Scarcity Entity | Buy star systems, fund galactic wars, create artificial planets, or rewrite entire markets through divine or cosmic means. |

### Buying goods and services from a different Tech. Level

When buying items that belong to a different tech level, the price is modified accordingly.

These prices are approximate, and subject to change. In general, prices are not discounted more than -4 because lower TL items can be scrapped for raw materials.

| Character TL - Item TL: | Approximate Price Difference: |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| -2                      | -4                            |
| -1                      | -2                            |
| 0                       | 0                             |
| 1                       | 2                             |
| 2                       | 4                             |
| >2                      | N/A (cannot be bought)        |

#### Antiquities

One notable exception to this rule is certain rare lower TL items that are considered "antiquities." Antiquities appreciate in value over time and can fetch exorbitant prices from collectors.

Feats (Continued)
------

### Defensive Feats

For contested actions, defenders may choose how they wish to defend themselves.

Common Defensive Feats:

- Dodge – Jump out of the way to avoid the attack
- Block – Use a shield or object to absorb impact
- Parry – Redirect or deflect the attack using a weapon
- Cover – Take shelter behind an obstacle
- Counterspell – Interrupt a spell with a spell of your own
- Judo Throw – Redirect an attack's momentum away from you
- Something else (be creative, add it to your Character Sheet)

After a character chooses their defensive Feat, they work with the GM to determine whether it receives a Bonus or Malus from their Aspects.

---

### Adding Feats to the Character Sheet

Characters in Atomic D6 are allowed to attempt any Feat, not just those written down on their character sheet.

The Feat list is meant as a quick reference for the GM and the players, so that they don't have to keep pausing the game to make rulings to ascertain how many dice to roll.

For instance: After fighting bandits, Kaelion captures one alive, and he wants to question the prisoner to determine the location of their hideout.

The GM rules that this is a new Feat called "Interrogation" and grants him a Half Bonus under the rationale that a Prince would have prior experience questioning subordinates and sorting out truth from lies.

Kaelion adds Interrogation to his list of Feats, with a Half Bonus. This way he doesn't have to wait for a GM ruling every time he uses this Feat in the future.

There is no limit on the number of Feats that can be added to the Character Sheet this way.

Example Feats by Successes Required
----------------------------------------------------

### Untrained (0 Successes)

Feats are unreliable tricks. They reflect clumsy attempts at technique, often failing under pressure and offering little advantage.

For example:

- Swing a melee weapon awkwardly with poor control.
- Struggle to block or parry attacks effectively.
- Grip weapons improperly, reducing their effectiveness.
- Loose arrows without control; often miss targets entirely.
- Throw weapons clumsily, with poor distance and accuracy.
- Fire guns with improper stance; risk jamming or hurting yourself.
- Fail to channel electricity in any meaningful way.
- Set up basic software or fix household electronics.
- Struggle with complex mechanical or digital systems.
- Fail to optimize or improve existing technologies.

### Apprentice (1 Success)

Feats are simple, functional skills. They cover basic techniques that work reliably in straightforward situations, but break down when challenged.

For example:

- Maintain proper stance and grip while fighting.
- Execute basic strikes and blocks with competence.
- Nock and release arrows smoothly, hitting stationary targets.
- Throw knives, spears, or axes with basic accuracy at short range.
- Fire firearms safely, hitting man-sized targets at close range.

- Design and construct advanced robotic or cybernetic enhancements.

### Master (3 Successes)

Feats are extraordinary displays of control. They push beyond ordinary limits, combining precision, creativity, and versatility to redefine what’s possible.

For example:

- Perform near-superhuman feats with weapons (e.g., cutting arrows in midair).
- Master fighting styles from multiple weapon traditions.
- Split an arrow or bullet already lodged in a target.
- Throw multiple knives or axes in quick succession, each hitting cleanly.
- Snipe moving targets at extreme distances with uncanny accuracy.

- Generate controlled plasma fields from raw electricity.
- Design intelligent AI, create life-supporting habitats.
- Develop fully automated industrial systems.
- Integrate organic and synthetic components seamlessly.

### Olympian (5 Successes)

Feats are mythic acts of mastery. They bend probability, momentum, and circumstance in your favor, often producing results that defy logic.

For example:

- Deflect bullets with a sword or energy blade.
- Intuitively predict opponents’ strikes before they happen.
- Handle any melee weapon with perfect control and mastery.
- Deflect incoming missiles with your own shots.
- Fire while moving acrobatically without loss of precision.

- Pin opponents to walls with a single well-placed shot.
- Control entire electrical grids and energy sources.
- Blackout or restore power to cities at will.
- Generate controlled plasma fields from raw electricity.
- Code software that predicts human behavior perfectly.
- Construct self-repairing structures and adaptive machines.
- Design smart cities that autonomously regulate themselves.


### Demigod (7 Successes)

Feats are world-shaping powers. They turn battles, collapse systems, or alter entire environments. Each use has sweeping impact.

For example:

- Move faster than the eye can track while striking.
- Deliver blows that can split reinforced armor.
- Battle entire squads without sustaining injury.
- Rain down volleys of arrows that blot out the sky.
- Fire projectiles that punch through multiple armored foes.
- Throw a spear across a battlefield to strike a commander through their guard.
- Every shot finds the most vulnerable point in armor, no matter the angle.
- Overload any device or power system.
- Disrupt communication networks with electromagnetic pulses.
- Convert energy into different forms, such as heat, motion, or light.
- Build sentient AI that can evolve over time.
- Develop self-replicating nanotechnology.
- Engineer machines capable of independent innovation and adaptation.

### Lesser Deity (10 Successes)

Feats are cosmic-scale dominions. They extend across vast distances and dimensions, overwhelming barriers that would stop any lesser technique.

For example:

- Destroy entire battlefields with a single swing.
- Use melee strikes to cleave through spacecraft hulls.
- Fight at supersonic speeds with no loss of control.
- Cut through energy fields, magic barriers, and force fields effortlessly.
- Thrown weapons can cross miles and still strike the target.
- Projectiles curve through time and space to hit any enemy you can name.
- Shots pierce magical wards, energy shields, or dimensional barriers.
- Manipulate the electromagnetic spectrum of an entire solar system.
- Control solar flares and coronal mass ejections from stars.
- Reshape planets by altering their core energy fields.
- Reshape stars using pure energy manipulation.

- Sever interdimensional connections with a blade.
- Command entire fleets using integrated neural circuits
- Subsume an entire global network into your consciousness via neural link
- Hack into a national power grid and completely disable it
- Control global weather patterns with magic rituals

### Elder Deity (13 Successes)

Feats are reality-defining truths. They no longer operate as techniques but as principles — universal laws that bend existence to your will.

For example:

- With a thought, all weapons in the universe become an extension of your being.
- All arrows in existence fly at your command.
- Throw weapons and strike foes on other worlds.
- Fire so perfectly that the concept of "distance" ceases to matter—every shot hits.
- Forge cosmic storms that span the universe.
- Control the flow of energy across galaxies without limit.
- Transcend physical form, existing as pure electromagnetic force.
- Forge entire universes as computational constructs.
- Develop technology that masters control of both space and time on a galactic scale

Inventory

Zone Movement
==================
Zones are arbitrary divisions of the map defined as the distance most characters can cover by moving for one [Beat](#Time).

If they do nothing else besides move, characters may move two Zones in one [Beat](#Time).

Characters with magical or technological augmentation may move faster or slower.

If the GM is using maps, it is expected that they divide them into Zones, or otherwise enforce Zone Movement when applicable.

A Note on Differing Movement Speeds
-----------------------------------------
If all parties are roughly the same speed, the GM is encouraged to make the Zones larger. For instance, during a chase between two motorcycles, the GM might make zones that take up an entire city block so that all characters can still move roughly one zone per [Beat](#Time).

**If characters are traveling at significantly different speeds,** the GM can draw smaller zones inside the larger ones. For instance: if a character suddenly dismounts their motorcycle during the chase, the GM can quickly delineate some smaller zones inside of the larger ones.

If the GM finds themselves having to draw too large or too small, they can feel free to run the action using two different maps at different scales.

| 8       | Instant          | An event that happens immediately.                                                    |

Flashbacks
------------
GMs may give out Flashbacks to players that they may use later.

At any time, characters may choose to spend a Flashback in order to remember a scene that happened in the past. They might remember that they packed certain equipment or planned ahead for a specific contingency that they're facing.

Flashbacks are still full scenes that can have major consequences on the progression of the sequence. Characters must roll for any Feats that they attempt, and deduct gold for any equipment they remember purchasing.

Flashbacks are not time travel. They can add additional past events, but they cannot cancel out past events that have already happened. If characters incur damage during the flashback, it manifests in the present, or the flashback simply fails to make any effect. This is particularly true if a character dies in a flashback.

---

Mounts and Vehicles
==========================

Mounts and Vehicles in Atomic D6 are treated much the same way as characters.

Characters may control a Mount or Vehicle with greater or less ability, depending upon their piloting skill.

If the mount or vehicle has a mind of its own (for instance, a horse, or a spaceship with an AI computer) it is considered a full-fledged character, and it may resist the pilot or decide to ignore their commands and do something else.

The character sheet for a mount or vehicle is nearly identical to a Player's character sheet, with the exception that vehicles have fuel instead of stamina, and they refuel instead of eating.

Damage to vehicles is still expressed via wounds. In this case, Minor Wounds represent cosmetic damage, and Major Wounds represent damage to critical systems.

Fuel is usually not lost when a vehicle takes a hit in the same way that characters lose stamina when they're hit. Rather, fuel is expended by movement, and performing piloting Feats.

Mounts and vehicles that are "alive" do not require a pilot to operate on their own, but when doing so, their ability to attempt Feats may be limited.

Instead of medical care, vehicles must be repaired. The difficulty of the repair job is determined by the severity of the damage, the level of the mechanic, and how technologically advanced the vehicle is.

---

Cybernetics
===============

Cybernetics are Aspects that are a part of a character's body, and they extend what characters can do.

Just like any other body part, cybernetics can be disabled by wounds.

Repairing a cybernetic implant is a complicated process requiring a Feat of "Cybernetics" performed by a skilled Cybernetician. Electronics experts and medical professionals without training in Cybernetics may attempt to heal an implant, but they receive a Half Bonus because this Feat is tangental to their area of expertise.

Just like any other Feats, Cybernetics consume Stamina, but they also require additional resources that vary depending upon the nature of the augmentation.

If the implant grants the character spellcasting abilities, it consumes Mana. In addition, some implants require an external power source. Others require fuel or ammunition. These resources are required for characters to keep their implants functioning.

It is assumed that players are recharging and refueling their cybernetics while eating and drinking. If characters lack the special resources needed to power their implants, they may regain Stamina, but their implants stop functioning.

---

Domains
==========
Overview
----------
At higher levels of play, characters might gain control over Domains: kingdoms, factions, corporations, or empires. This system allows players to engage in large-scale politics, warfare, economics, and diplomacy while preserving Atomic D6's streamlined mechanics.

Much like Characters, each Domain has a Concept, Aspects, and Holdings that define its strengths and weaknesses. Domain Feats occur in Domain Turns, which typically represent at least one Sequence, and could possibly span months or even years.

Domain Feats are useful in order to determine how large events unfold in the background of the game, in between the player's actions. For instance: to determine whether an invasion succeeds, the attacker and defender can roll a single contest between Domain Feats.

---
Gaining Control of a Domain
--------------------------------
Characters may assume control over a Domain in various ways, depending on the game's narrative and setting. Here are some common paths to Domain leadership:

### 1. Inheritance & Bloodlines
- A character may inherit a Domain through noble birth, royal succession, or familial legacy.
- The transition of power may be smooth or contested, requiring political maneuvering or even military force.

### 2. Military Conquest
- A Domain may be seized through force of arms, either by leading an army or orchestrating a coup.
- Conquest may lead to resistance, uprisings, or logistical challenges in maintaining control over the new territory.

### 3. Political Intrigue & Manipulation
- Characters skilled in diplomacy, espionage, or blackmail may rise to power through political games.
- Gaining favor with key factions, eliminating rivals, or forging alliances can shift the balance of power.

### 4. Religious or Ideological Authority
- A character may lead a Domain by being the head of a major faith, cult, or revolutionary movement.
- Spiritual influence or ideological fervor can unite people under a leader’s vision, granting control over a Domain.

### 5. Economic Domination
- Control over trade, resources, or financial institutions can allow a character to dominate a region.
- Merchant princes, crime lords, or industrial magnates can use wealth to buy power, fund armies, or topple rulers.

### 6. Divine or Supernatural Intervention
- A character may gain a Domain by receiving divine mandate, mystical power, or otherworldly backing.
- Gods, ancient spirits, or eldritch entities may bestow rulership upon a worthy (or cursed) individual.

### 7. Democratic or Popular Election
- In some societies, rulers are elected by councils, senates, or the will of the people.
- Winning an election or leading a popular movement can grant legitimate control over a Domain.

### 8. Founding a New Domain
- A character may carve out a new Domain in unclaimed or hostile lands.
- This could involve settling a colony, uniting scattered factions, or leading a nomadic horde to glory.

Gaining control over a Domain often comes with challenges, including rival factions, internal instability, and external threats. Players must navigate these obstacles to maintain and expand their rule.

---

Regents, Ministers, and Managers
--------------------------------------
Leaders that wish to go out on adventures must leave someone in charge of their Domain. It goes without saying that this requires a great deal of trust.

During each Domain Turn, leaders may issue standing orders to their Ministers, who will (usually) execute them to the best of their ability.

If leaders are out of communication, their Ministers will follow standing orders and do their best to react to situations as they arise.

Gaining Aspects from Domains
---------------------------------
When a character is part of a Domain (such as a Faction, Kingdom, or Guild), they can gain an Aspect that represents their role, rank, and influence within that Domain.

These Aspects change how people react to the character. They might grant Bonuses or Maluses in relevant situations, and they might allow characters access to new resources.

| Aspect Example                    | Bonus                                  | Malus                                    |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "Knight of the Sun Court"         | when negotiating with nobility         | when dealing with criminal organizations |
| "Member of the Alchemist’s Guild" | to crafting potions                    | when bartering outside the guild         |
| "Crimson Blades Enforcer"         | to intimidation in mercenary contracts | when dealing with nobility               |

### Changing Domain Aspects
- Promotion or Demotion: Characters may gain or lose ranks within a Domain, altering their Aspects.
- Defection or Betrayal: Leaving a Domain may replace the Aspect with something negative (e.g., "Exiled from the Sun Court").
- Multiple Domain Aspects: A character may belong to multiple Domains, but they might find it increasingly difficult to manage split allegiances.

By treating Domains as living, evolving entities, these Aspects help shape how characters interact with the world and how the world reacts to them.

Progression of Domains
--------------------------

A Domain's Concept Bonus represents the scope of its political, social, and cultural influence.

Just like when Characters advance, when a Domain expands or contracts, the GM may call for a roll of one or more [Advancements](#Concept-Bonus-Advancement) to determine whether its Concept Bonus changes.

| Bonus | Scope of Power | Examples                                                               |
|-------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| +0    | Powerless      | Scattered unaffiliated individuals, a failed kingdom, or outlawed cult |
| +2    | Village        | A locality, minor guild, or small mercenary band                       |
| +4    | Province       | A large city or province, a city-state                                 |
| +6    | Kingdom        | A nation, a large faith, a military order                              |
| +9    | Empire         | A realm controlling multiple nations                                   |
|-------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| +14   | Planet         | A planetary empire, a world religion                                   |
| +20   | Interstellar   | An interstellar republic, a galactic megacorp                          |
| +26   | Galactic       | A civilization spanning multiple galaxies                              |

### Levels of Wealth for Domains

Wealth for Domains works differently from the way wealth works for Characters because Domains accumulate shared resources that are held in common.

It is generally assumed that Domains can afford goods and services equivalent to their Concept Bonus.

For instance: a province can afford to field a garrison of troops and build city walls. A village can afford to construct a modest guild hall. An Empire can afford multiple majestic fleets of ships.

A Domain's Wealth Level is based on its Concept Bonus and it increases or decreases via [Advancement](#Concept-Bonus-Advancement) when the Domain gains or loses wealth. Just like Characters, Domains only track significant changes in Wealth. Individual coins are not counted.

For instance: the Concept Bonus of an Empire is usually +9, but an impoverished Empire run by a corrupt leader that bankrupted their coffers may receive -2 to their Wealth Level, bringing it down to +7. When making financial decisions, leaders of such an Empire receive only +7 instead of the full +9.

A leader of a Domain may not extract personal wealth from their Domain's treasury without consequences.

Domain Turns
--------------
Domain Turns happen in-between Sequences of player actions:

1. Players issue orders to regents, ministers and managers and narrate what their characters are planning to do while orders are being carried out.
2. Optionally, the GM may narrate additional scenes that spotlight player actions and choices during the Domain Turn
3. GM sets difficulty for Domain Feats and determines which Bonuses apply. This difficulty can be influenced by player actions and choices.
4. One of the players rolls Domain Feat Die, and the Atomic D6
5. The GM narrates the outcome at a high level and determines how many Character and Domain resources were consumed

Domain Feats vs. Individual Feats
---------------------------------------
Domain Feats require characters to issue orders to the members of their organization. Giving orders is not always easy; it can be a feat of communication and diplomacy in and of itself.

After the regent, minister, or manager of the domain receives the orders, they (usually) execute them to the best of their ability. They pass orders to their subordinates, and the Domain Feat is executed.

Domain Feats are resolved in the same manner as Character Feats, by looking at Domain Aspects to determine relevant Bonuses and Maluses and rolling Feat Die accordingly.

Example Domain Feats by Successes Required
-------------------------------------------------
#### Powerless (0 Successes)

Feats are unreliable or impossible. The collective lacks organization and cannot act meaningfully at scale.

- Struggle to provide food and shelter.
- Vulnerable to outside threats without coordination.
- Cannot build or defend infrastructure reliably.
- Survival depends on luck or outside aid.

#### Village (1 Success)

    Feats are simple, functional collective efforts. They work reliably in straightforward conditions but break down under large-scale stress.

- Feed and shelter a small population.
- Defend against bandits or wild beasts.
- Build basic fortifications (palisades, watchtowers).
- Craft simple weapons and tools for survival.
- Organize hunting, farming, or herding at subsistence levels.

#### Province (2 Successes)

Feats are established and dependable. They represent an organized society capable of coordinating people and resources.

- Maintain trade routes and regional roads.
- Field professional militias or small armies.
- Establish marketplaces and cultural centers.
- Build ships, mines, or workshops at scale.
- Withstand sieges or regional disasters.

#### Kingdom (3 Successes)

Feats are extraordinary at the scale of nations. They push beyond ordinary limits and display creativity, versatility, and control.

- Wage wars across borders.
- Establish cities, universities, and guilds.
- Shape culture, laws, and religious movements.
- Build wonders of the world (cathedrals, castles, colossal statues).
- Develop bureaucracies to manage large populations.

#### Empire (5 Successes)

Feats are mythic acts of mastery at the civilizational scale. They bend probability and momentum in favor of an entire people.

- Conquer and integrate diverse cultures.
- Control trade and communication across continents.
- Build vast navies or armies with near-limitless reach.
- Shape religions or ideologies to unify millions.
- Construct early megastructures (Great Walls, sprawling aqueduct systems).

#### Planet (7 Successes)

Feats are world-shaping acts. They alter environments, ecosystems, and societies permanently.

- Terraform regions to suit needs.
- Mobilize billions for planetary projects.
- Establish orbital defenses and interplanetary reach.
- Harness planetary-scale energy sources (fusion grids, massive reactors).
- Build structures visible from space (orbital elevators, supercities).

#### Interstellar (10 Successes)

Feats extend across solar systems. They overwhelm barriers that would stop any lesser collective.

- Colonize multiple star systems.
- Build fleets capable of interstellar dominance.
- Harvest stars for energy (Dyson swarms).
- Coordinate economies spanning light-years.
- Rewrite stellar cartography through exploration and conquest.

#### Galactic (13 Successes)

Feats are reality-defining at the largest civilizational scale. They reshape existence for all under their control.

- Dictate galactic trade, law, or culture.
- Build megastructures around entire stars.
- Re-engineer galactic phenomena (wormholes, black holes).
- Manipulate entire species’ evolution across millennia.
- Rewrite history or culture at a galactic scale.

Crafting and Technology
==============================

All items in Atomic D6 can be crafted
----------------------------------------------

Any item in Atomic D6 can be crafted. The difficulty of a crafting feat depends on several factors:
- Aspect Bonus of the craftsman
- Tech. Level (TL) of the craftsman
- TL and quality of the craftsman's tools
- TL of the item being crafted
- Intrinsic complexity of the item being crafted

Technology is Cultural
---------------------------

Technology level is a cultural shorthand rather than a universal law.

Different societies can have members from different TLs and cultures simultaneously. For instance: on Earth, individuals from post-industrial societies coexist with those from hunter-gatherer societies.

TL represents the advancement of tools, knowledge, and infrastructure available to a craftsman.

Different worlds may develop along different paths with TLs. For instance: a civilization might enter modernity on a world where fossil fuels don't exist.

GMs are encouraged to tweak or reinterpret TLs depending on their campaign setting.

Crafting Costs
------------------

- Man hours
- Components
- Beats

Large Projects
------------------

- Example: Castles, Starships, Dyson Spheres
- Can require multiple Domain Feats to craft
- Can require thousands or millions of man hours
- Each Feat might span hours, years, or millennia, depending on the subjective scope of the Narrative
- Each Feat requires a roll of the Atomic D6

Technological Distance Makes Crafting Harder
-------------------------------------------------------

Some items are so distant from the craftsman's TL that they are difficult to make.

For instance: a modern human might struggle to knap flint, his ancestors having lost the art long ago. Conversely, he might struggle while trying to craft a faster-than-light drive because his grasp of the technology is so simplistic that it is indistinguishable from magic for him.

In both situations, characters receive a Malus to crafting the item.


Tech. Levels of Civilizations
------------------------------------

### T0 - Stone Age (Prehistoric Survivalists)

- Power is measured in physical prowess, survival skills, and oral traditions.

- AI2 - Hybrid Civilization (AI-Organic Merge): AI and organic life permanently integrate, creating a post-biological superintelligence.
- AI3 - AI Collapse (Runaway Intelligence): AI expands unchecked, consuming all resources or turning against its creators.
- AI4 - AI as a Tool (Benevolent AI Governance): AI serves as a perfect steward, guiding civilizations without eliminating free will.
- AI5 - AI Dystopia (Digital Slavery): AI dominates, controlling every aspect of life, leaving biological beings as second-class citizens.

---

### Potential Conflicts for T8+ Civilizations

Sometimes it can be difficult for the GM to imagine what might possibly cause divine beings to come into conflict. These suggestions can be a jumping-off point.

#### 1. Reality Wars (Conflicts Over the Nature of Existence)

- Some factions want to preserve the base reality, while others seek to collapse all matter into simulation.
- Battle between those who see physical existence as obsolete and those who still value it.

#### 2. The Collapse vs. Expansion Dilemma

Worldbuilding Through High-Level Play
=================================================

In Atomic D6, the campaign world is not static: it is a Narrative, just like the events unfolding in play. Instead of starting with a pre-built setting, players can create the world dynamically by taking on the roles of divine beings, primordial forces, or legendary founders. Through Domain Level Play, they may shape history, establish civilizations, and define the world's fundamental laws, all while telling an evolving story.

---

Playing as an Elder Deity
-----------------------------

_"That is not dead which can eternal lie... and with strange aeons even death may die."_ - H.P. Lovecraft

Elder Deities take turns called Primordial Aeons.

In the Primordial Aeons, the Elder Deities can create or modify any one of the Atomic Elements:

- Cosmology
  - Natural and Magical Laws
  - Lesser Deities
- Planetology
- Geography
- Species
- History and Prehistory:
    - Domains
        - Cultures
        - Nations
        - Factions
        - Religions
    - Characters
        - Motivations
        - Conflicts
    - Periods
    - Events

Elder Deities can add Atomic Elements to the beginning, middle, or end of history at any time during the Primordial Aeons.

Atomic Elements cannot be removed from the game once they are introduced, however, they can be killed or destroyed by historical events introduced later.

---

Game Setting
--------------

When they reach a consensus, or a predetermined number of Primordial Aeons, the Elder Deities may decide to begin the next phase of the game.

Based on the setting that they created, the Elder Deities work with the players in order to determine the time period and location of the beginning of the game.

After that, players will need to work with the GM to determine their starting Concept Bonus, and create characters with Concepts rooted in the setting that they created.

---

Playing as Multiple Characters
========================================

With GM permission, a player may control more than one character simultaneously, such as a wizard and their fighter bodyguard.

Rules for Multiple Characters:
-----------------------------------

- Distinct Roles: Each character should have a unique function in the party to prevent redundancy.
- Balanced Spotlight: The GM should ensure that a single player does not dominate the game, allowing all players equal engagement.
- Action Economy: When controlling multiple characters, a player must manage their actions fairly, ensuring each character follows initiative order appropriately.
- Character Cohesion: If playing multiple characters, they should have a reason to work together, whether through bonds, employment, or shared goals.
- GM Discretion: The GM may impose limits, such as preventing players from running more than two characters at once or restricting additional characters to support roles.

This rule allows for more flexible storytelling and party compositions, ensuring each player can contribute to the game in a meaningful way.

---

Solo Play
-----------

In some cases, a player may wish to take on the role of both the player and the GM, running an entire game by themselves. This allows for personalized storytelling, experimentation, and world-building.

- Structured Improvisation: Since the player is also the GM, they should establish loose guidelines and tools (random tables, oracle decks, or AI-assisted prompts) to generate unexpected challenges.
- Self-Limiting Mechanics: To maintain balance, the player should follow standard rules for action economy, combat, and skill checks without favoring their character.
- Journaling & Logs: Keeping a session journal helps track progress, world changes, and character development.
- Randomization & Uncertainty: Using dice rolls or external resources (such as solo RPG engines) can prevent predictable outcomes and keep the game engaging.

Solo play provides a way for players to explore narratives at their own pace, experiment with world-building, and refine gameplay mechanics without needing a traditional group setup.

Why is this game called Atomic D6?
=============================================

The Atom is the smallest stable unit found in nature, but despite its small size, the Atom contains a great deal of potential energy, and it can be combined into many different forms.
