## What is an Aspect?

**Aspects are things that a character has.** As long as a character has an Aspect, it is true. If the Aspect ceases to be true, or if the character no longer has it, it is removed from their sheet.

## Character Creation

Fill in the blanks:
* Concept
* Backstory
* Heritage
* Bond
* Strong Attribute
* Flaw
* Skills

Characters may choose 4 Skills with *, two with * *, and one with * * *.

They may also choose to give up * * * in exchange for two Skills with * *

For example:
```
* * *   Necromancy
* *     Transmutation
* *     Wealth
*       Lore / Arcana
*       Alchemy
*       Notice
*       Logic	
Intimidation	
Athletics	
Will	
Stealth	
```

Alternate example (Giving up one skill with * * * for two skills with * *):
```
* *     Necromancy
* *     Armizare / Axes
* *     Armizare / Shields
* *     Armor / Heavy
* *     Wealth
*       Lore / Arcana
*       Alchemy
*       Notice
*       Logic	
Intimidation	
Athletics	
Will	
Stealth	
```

### General and specific skills
There is no "general" Magic skill, and players are encouraged to pick specific skills like "Necromancy" instead.

Armizare is the knightly study of the use of weaponry. Within Armizare, players may choose specific topics to focus on.

The DM is encouraged to offer players greater bonuses for skill rolls that are within their area of expertise, and smaller bonuses for rolls that are only tangentally related.

For example: A DM might decide to grant a character specializing in Armizare / Axes a bonus of 3D for attacking with axes. If the player decides to pick up a sword instead, the DM might rule that fencing with Swords would definitely be a part of Armizare training, even if they weren't the character's main focus. As a result, the DM might decide to grant the character a 1D bonus when fighting with swords.

Keep in mind that these bonuses are subject to change since all skill rolls in Atomic D6 are relative. If the player comes up against a heavily armored opponent, the DM might rule that any advantages the player had with axes are negated, and their chance to hit is still only "Middling" (1D)

### Default Skills
DMs and players are encouraged to fill in the blanks and choose whatever skills they want, as long as the group agrees and they fit the setting. Nevertheless, there are a few skills that are used frequently, across many different settings, and DMs are encouraged to include them in the game by default. Those skills are listed below:

**Athletics** Determines a character's physical resilience and their ability to run, jump, and perform various feats of strength. Each of these can be chosen as sub-specialties within the same skill.

**Logic** Determines a character's mental acuity and problem solving abilities.

**Lore** Has hundreds of possible sub-disciplines that cover all kinds of book learning and received wisdom.

**Notice** Determines how likely a character is to spot things that are hidden. It is not limited to vision. Some characters may specialize in noticing particular kinds of things. For instance: a hunter specializing in "Notice / Wilderness" might receive a large bonus for spotting tracks in the wilderness and a small bonus for noticing things in general.

**Social** has many different sub-disciplines, including Bluffing, Interrogation, Leadership, Haggling, and Intimidation.

**Stealth** is what characters roll in order to avoid being **Noticed**. It also covers the use of many different types of camoflage and decoys.

**Wealth** is a special kind of skill because it increases and decreases when characters make large transactions, and it dictates what they can afford. Unlike other skills, Wealth is always general; there are no sub-skills within it because Wealth is usually readily convertible into other forms of Wealth.

**Will** represents a character's mental fortitude. Strong-willed characters are more resistant to their mind being dominated and less likely to give up when their morale is low.

In addition to these default skills, players are encouraged to choose some combat skills. There are no general combat skills. Instead, players are encouraged to pick specific martial arts, like Armizare (The Medieval Art of Armaments) or Archery. In a modern setting, players might choose skills like "Military Combatives," "Brazilian Jiu Jitsu," "Firearms," or "Heavy Weapons."

As with other skills, specialization is possible. Characters that simply studied "Armizare" will get a middling bonus to all acts of knightly combat, but if they specialize in "Armizare / Longsword" they receive a Larger bonus to the Longsword in addition to a small bonus to all acts of knightly combat.

## Skill Rolls
Whenever players attempt to use their skills, the DM decides their chance of success, from *Awful* to *Superb*, and awards them an appropriate number of D6. Players also roll the *Atomic D6*, which determines if they receive a Boon, Bane, or nothing.

If the Skill Roll is considered trivial or impossible, the DM may declare that a roll is not needed.

Skill Rolls are always relative, and never absolute. For example, a player may attack with a powerful magical weapon, but if their target has exceptional armor, the DM might decide their chance of a successful attack is only "Middling," and ask them to roll 1d6.

## Turn-Based Combat

1) Reaction Rolls:

If both parties detect each other, the players may attempt a reaction roll. Players that succeed get to act first. Next, their opponents act. Players that failed their reaction roll get to act last.

If the players have not been detected yet, they win this reaction roll by default.

1) Players Attack

When players announce their attack, the DM assigns a difficulty to their roll, and they roll the appropriate number of dice.

The difficulty of the roll should take into consideration the target's armor, their ability to parry, dodge, and resist, and any other mitigating factors. If the player succeeds on their roll, their attack is successful.

Players may move either before or after they attack. A typical Mortal can move about one zone per combat turn without magical or technological augmentation.

Players may also speak in combat, but they are limited to ten syllables per turn.

2) Players Defend

On the NPCs turn, the DM may move them and declare their attacks.

When NPCs attack, the players roll to defend. If the players fail, the attack succeeds.

For each attack that the players must defend against in a turn, they recieve a disadvantage on their next defensive roll.

Notably, Atomic D6 is different from other popular TTRPG systems in that it is asymmetric. NPCs usually do not roll to defend or attack. In accordance with the Atomic D6 philosophy, duplicate rolls and excess calculation are eliminated wherever possible in order to speed the game.

### Example Attack Outcomes
- **Success with Boon**: The player attacks successfully, gaining an additional benefit (e.g., catching the opponent off-balance and getting a second attack).
- **Success**: The player strikes their target successfully.
- **Success with Bane**: The player hits but leaves themselves open for counterattack.
- **Failure with Boon**: The player misses, but the enemy also falters in some way.
- **Failure**: The player misses outright.
- **Failure with Bane**: The player fails and suffers an additional setback (e.g., their weapon breaks).

## Quick Skirmishes

If the story warrants that a combat should be resolved quickly, the DM determines the difficulty of the entire battle and lets one player roll.

Alternatively, each player may roll individually to decide their fate during the battle and how much they had to exert themselves.

---

## Large-Scale Battles

For larger battles, like a planetary invasion, the DM may run a series of Quick Skirmishes. Each skirmish will require its own roll.

- **Example Large-Scale Battle**:
  - **Stage 1**: The player's fleet begins an orbital bombardment. The DM rules a "Fair" chance of success, allowing 2D6. They roll and get *Success with Bane*. The players destroy the defenses but lose 30% of their troops, and their capital ship is damaged.
  - **Stage 2**: Landing troops. The DM decides it‚Äôs a "Good" chance. They roll and succeed without Bane or Boon.
  - **Stage 3**: Occupying the capitals. They roll a *Failure with Boon*, meaning they capture only one capital but gain a potential ally that offers to help them seize power in exchange for acting as their planetary governor.

## Glossary

- **Boon**: A beneficial side effect, often unexpected.
- **Bane**: A detrimental side effect.
- **DM**: Dungeon Master, the game's storyteller and referee.
- **1D**: One six-sided die.
