Rules at a Glance
========================

## Character Concept
Character Concept is a special kind of Aspect that encapsulates the core of their persona.

Concept is always accompanied by a number in parenthesis called Concept Bonus, which indicates the scope of the Character's power.

## Feat Dice
Characters roll a number of Dice equal to their Concept Bonus if attempting a Feat that directly relates to their Aspects.

| Feat Dice Result: | Description:  |
|-------------------|---------------|
| 1-3               | Failure       |
| 4-5               | Success       |
| 6                 | Two successes |

## Atomic D6

| Atomic D6 Result: | Description:                 |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| 1-2               | Bane: a negative story beat. |
| 3-4               | Neutral                      |
| 5-6               | Boon: a positive story beat. |

The Atomic D6 is rolled whenever characters attempt a Feat. It represents narrative circumstances outside of their control that are independent of the success or failure of the Feat.

## Aspects Expand Concept Bonus
Aspects describe a Character and expand the scope of situations where they can apply their Concept Bonus.

Example: “Swordsman” lets a Character apply Concept Bonus on combat Feats with a Sword. “Diplomacy” lets a Character apply them in negotiations.

## Half Bonus (Tangential Feats)
If the Feat is only tangentially related to a Character's Aspect, they may roll Concept / 2, rounded up.

## Maluses
An Aspect that hinders a character is called a Malus.

Characters subject to a Malus receive only a Half Bonus to Aspects that are affected by the Malus.

If the Feat that they are attempting is already tangental and also subject to a Malus, their Bonus is further reduced to 1/3.

For instance: Kaelion's sword arm is slashed in combat with a Brigand. He receives a minor wound. This wound is an Aspect that grants him a Malus to Swordsmanship and anything else that requires the use of that arm.

## Small Bonuses and Maluses
The GM can grant Small Bonuses to represent minor advantages.

Granting players "a pip" allows them to turn a 3 into a 4, turning a failure into a success in certain situations.

A pip can be represented as ".1." For instance, the GM might grant a player with an Aspect Bonus of 3 a Bonus of two pips to represent an expertly sharpened blade, bringing their Swordsmanship Aspect Bonus up to 3.2 when wielding that blade.

If players ever have +.3 pips, they are converted to a Bonus of a full dice (+1**

## Passive Bonus
To reduce unnecessary rolling, the GM may ask players to convert their Aspect Bonus into an average number of automatic successes.

For example: a Concept Bonus of 4 / 2 rounded up = 2 automatic successes without rolling.

Passive Bonus is also used to determine how difficult it is to hit a character when they are defending.

## Floor for Defensive Feats
To prevent automatic failure, all characters have a floor for Defensive Feats.

Defensive Floor = Concept / 3 rounded down.

This floor is applied when a character is forced to use a Defensive Feat that does not relate to any of their Aspects.

## Contests
There are three ways to resolve Feats that involve Characters directly opposing one another:

**Active vs Active:** both sides roll their dice; higher number of successes wins.

**Active vs Passive:** one side rolls; the other uses their Passive Bonus.

**Passive vs Passive:** compare Passive Bonuses; higher total wins.

The GM may choose from these methods to determine how Feats are resolved.

## Group Feats
When two or more characters work together to perform a feat, if the majority succeed, the group succeeds.

To calculate the Passive Bonus for a group, use the average Passive Bonus of all members.

The GM has the option to add or subtract a Bonus that scales to account for differences in group size:
- A small group may receive +2 for Stealth, and -2 in combat against a larger group.
- If the groups are vastly outmatched in size, the GM can declare an automatic success or failure

## Domain Feats
At a certain point, calculating Group Feats begins to become unwieldy, and something more is needed.

Domains represent large groups that perform Feats as a single unit.

Domains have a Concept and Aspects, and they function almost like Characters, but on a much grander scale.

The section on [Domains](#Domains) has more information.

## Feat Bonuses Summarized:

These rules of Atomic D6 may seem overwhelming at first, but there are only three numbers that characters actually need to remember:

| Feat relationship to Aspect:                 | Calculation (rounded):    |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Directly related                             | Full Concept Bonus        |
| Directly related but also subject to a Malus | 1/2 Concept Bonus rounded |
| Tangentally related                          | 1/2 Concept Bonus rounded |
| Tangentally related and subject to a Malus   | 1/3 Concept Bonus rounded |
| Not related                                  | 1/3 Concept Bonus rounded |
| Not related and subject to a Malus           | 1/3 Concept Bonus rounded |

## Magic

### Spellcasting Aspects
Characters require at least one Spellcasting Aspect in order to cast spells.

Every Spellcasting Aspect must be tied to a school of magic, which defines the limits of their abilities.

- A school of magic may come from the Domain of a Divine Patron (such as a God or Goddess) or from the study of a magical discipline (such as Pyromancy, Necromancy, or Illusion).

### Casting a Spell
1. Declare Intent: The player announces that their character is attempting to cast a spell.
2. Describe the Spell: The player describes the effect in narrative terms.
3. GM Sets Difficulty: The GM determines the base difficulty for the spell.
   - Players are encouraged to keep a book of frequently used spells with their base difficulty written down.
   - The GM may modify the base difficulty depending upon situational Aspects or special defenses (e.g., target armor, magical wards).
4. Roll Feat Dice + Atomic D6:
   - Roll as if casting were a Feat, applying the Spellcasting Aspect.
   - The Atomic D6 may generate special consequences.
   - Passive scores may not be used when casting spells: players must roll every time.

### Outcomes
- Success: The spell is cast as intended.
- Failure: The spell fizzles and does not manifest.
- Boon (Atomic D6): The spell is unexpectedly more powerful or produces a beneficial side effect.
  - Spells that are unexpectedly more powerful may also be dangerous to the player and their allies!
- Bane (Atomic D6): The caster takes a hit from magical strain, regardless of success or failure. This may represent backlash, fatigue, or psychic stress.

### Eldritch Burden:

Characters may concentrate to maintain a conjured magical effect for longer than a Beat.

Concentrating in this way requires characters to channel powerful eldritch energies with visible effects. For instance: a pyromancer straining to maintain a spell might sprout magical flames from their eyes that grow higher depending on how much strain they have incurred.

### Death by Magical Strain

If characters die by Magical Strain, powerful Eldritch energies are released. For instance: a pyromancer might explode in a violent fireball.

### Paradox
Magic is bound by the rules of the world. Characters who attempt to repeatedly bend or break those rules strain the fabric of reality itself.
- Such transgressions cause Paradox, making subsequent castings of the same world-breaking spell increasingly difficult.
- The GM escalates the difficulty each time a Paradox-causing spell is attempted.
- Paradox represents reality “pushing back” against the caster, and can have narrative as well as mechanical consequences.

Understanding Parts of the Atomic D6 Character Sheet
======================================================================
Concept
--------
A character's Concept is a single line that describes them, followed by a number in parentheses. The number represents their level of ability.

Aspects
--------
Aspects are parts of a Character Concept. If the Aspect ceases to be true, or if the Character Concept no longer has it, it is removed from their sheet.

An Aspect can provide Bonuses in some situations and Maluses in others.

Characters are allowed no more than three Aspects at creation time, but the GM may add additional Aspects to them later on.

Stamina
--------
When a character takes damage, they lose Stamina. Consuming Stamina in this way represents a character getting the wind knocked out of them, or expending their energy to take evasive action.

At the GM's discretion, some actions like sprinting or concentrating for a long period of time are particularly taxing and may also consume Stamina.

If the character has no more Stamina at the time they take damage, they receive a Wound.

Wounds
-------
Wounds represent damage to a character which can be either physical or mental.

When characters take damage and they have no more Stamina to spend, they are required to take a Wound.

#### Light Wounds
Scratches, grazes, and bruises.

#### Medium Wounds
Lacerations, sprains, dislocations, second degree burns, concussions, mild psychological problems.

#### Heavy Wounds
Broken bones, amputations, infections, third degree burns, arterial bleeding, brain damage, semi-permanent psychological damage.

#### Eating and Drinking
Characters can recover Stamina naturally by taking 30 minutes of light activity to eat and drink.

The difficulty of recovering Stamina in this way is usually 1, but lower quality rations and rest make it harder. When resting, players must roll once per point of stamina that they are attempting to recover.

#### Sleeping
Wounds have a chance to heal naturally after characters have slept for eight hours.

Upon waking, characters roll once per Wound in order to determine if they have healed.

Depending upon the severity of the wound and the quality of the character's sleep, they can be easier or harder to heal.

Certain species like robots do not eat, sleep, or drink, but they do require maintenance, and they have their own rules around stamina recovery.

Death
------
When a character takes damage and all of their Stamina and Wounds have already been consumed, they begin to die, and they may choose how to spend their last breaths:

#### Inspiring last words

You are mortally wounded, but your death need not be in vain. You use your last burst of energy to utter rousing last words which grant all allies within hearing distance a Boon which they may use however they wish within the next ten minutes.

#### Adrenaline

You take your last breaths and adrenaline keeps you functioning and grants you a Boon to use however you want. In addition, you take an extra turn right at this moment. At the end of that turn, you die, regardless of any healing you receive.

#### Critical Condition

You become incapacitated and focus all your energy on staying alive. Roll D6 at this moment, and at the beginning of each subsequent turn until you die or return to consciousness:

| D6:  | Result:                                                                      |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 6:   | Against all odds, you regain a point of Stamina and return to consciousness. |
| 4-5: | Survive for another turn.                                                    |
| 1-3: | Slip into the abyss and die.                                                 |

If characters receive prompt medical attention, they may receive Bonuses to these rolls.

##### Death by Mental Wounds

_"some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age."_ - H.P. Lovecraft

In Atomic D6, Mental Wounds are considered to be just as deadly as physical ones. When a character dies due to Mental Wounds, their body remains in tact, but their personality is destroyed by the gravity of the cosmic horrors that they have witnessed. They are unresponsive, unable even to eat or drink, and nothing short of a magical or technological miracle can bring them back.

Character Progression
-------------------------
| Character Concept Level: | Aspect Bonus: |
|--------------------------|---------------|
| Untrained                | +0            |
| Apprentice               | +2            |
| Journeyman               | +4            |
| Master                   | +6            |
| Olympian                 | +9            |
| Demigod                  | +10           |
| Lesser Deity             | +19           |
| Elder Deity              | +25           |

---

Feats
------
Whenever players attempt to do something, the GM decides their chance of success, from *Awful* to *Superb*, and grants them a number of D6. Players also roll the *Atomic D6*, which determines if they receive a Boon or a Bane.
If the Feat is considered trivial or impossible, a roll is usually not needed unless the GM explicitly calls for it.

### Passive Bonuses
To make a Bonus passive, divide it by two, and round up.

During a contest where one character is active and another is passive, the active character must roll a number greater or equal to the Passive character's score.

### Half-Bonuses
In some cases, a character may attempt a Feat that is not fully within their Concept but it makes sense that their Concept might grant them a half bonus.

In these cases, the GM may rule that the character receives a Bonus of half their Concept level rounded up.

### Minimum Defensive Bonus

Characters are granted a one-third-Bonus at minimum when defending.

### Feat Dice

| Result | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 4-6    | Success     |
| 1-3    | Failure     |

### The Atomic D6

| **Roll:** | **Description:** |
|-----------|------------------|
| 5-6       | Boon             |
| 3-4       | Nothing          |
| 1-2       | Bane             |

Whilst Feat Dice represent a character's ability to perform a Feat, the Atomic D6 represents the narrative forces of chaos and fate, and everything outside of their control.

Narrative [Beats](#Time) that occur as a result of Boons and Banes do not necessarily have to relate to the feat the character was attempting. Sometimes fortune comes out of left field.

In certain situations where many rolls are happening back to back, the GM may call for only one Atomic D6 for the sake of speed and simplicity.

#### Variant Rule: "There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."

Some groups don't like the randomness that the Atomic D6 adds to the game. Others might want to substitute their own GM Oracle. In that case, they may choose to play without the Atomic D6.

#### Understanding the Atomic D6 in Context with Feats

| **Description:** | **Result:**       |
|------------------|-------------------|
| "Yes, and..."    | Success with Boon |
| "Yes."           | Success           |
| "Yes, but..."    | Success with Bane |
| "No, but..."     | Failure with Boon |
| "No."            | Failure           |
| "No, and..."     | Failure with Bane |

#### Uncontested Feats

---

#### Contested Feats

---

#### Defensive Feats

For contested actions, defenders may choose a Defensive Feat to raise the effective difficulty of the attack (by increasing the attacker’s Feat Level).

Common Defensive Feats:

- Dodge – Avoid the attack entirely
- Block – Use a shield or object to absorb impact
- Parry – Redirect or deflect the attack
- Cover – Take shelter behind an obstacle
- Counterspell – Interrupt magical effects
- Judo Throw – Redirect melee momentum
- Something else (be creative)

GMs assign an appropriate Feat Level to the chosen defense and apply it to the attacker’s calculation.

---

### Adding Feats to the Character Sheet

Characters in Atomic D6 are allowed to attempt any Feat, not just those written down on their character sheet.

The Feat list is meant as a quick reference for the GM and the players, so that they don't have to keep pausing the game to make rulings to ascertain how many dice to roll.

For instance: After fighting bandits, Kaelion captures one alive, and he wants to question the prisoner to determine the location of their hideout.

The GM rules that this is a new Feat called "Interrogation" and grants him a Half Bonus under the rationale that a Prince would have prior experience questioning subordinates and sorting out truth from lies.

Kaelion adds Interrogation to his list of Feats, with a Half Bonus. This way he doesn't have to wait for a GM ruling every time he uses this Feat in the future.

There is no limit on the number of Feats that can be added to the Character Sheet this way.

Example Feats by Approximate Character Level
----------------------------------------------------

### Untrained (1 Success)

Feats are unreliable tricks. They reflect clumsy attempts at technique, often failing under pressure and offering little advantage.

For example:

- Swing a melee weapon awkwardly with poor control.
- Struggle to block or parry attacks effectively.
- Grip weapons improperly, reducing their effectiveness.
- Loose arrows without control; often miss targets entirely.
- Throw weapons clumsily, with poor distance and accuracy.
- Fire guns with improper stance; risk jamming or hurting yourself.
- Fail to channel electricity in any meaningful way.
- Set up basic software or fix household electronics.
- Struggle with complex mechanical or digital systems.
- Fail to optimize or improve existing technologies.

### Apprentice (2 Successes)

Feats are simple, functional skills. They cover basic techniques that work reliably in straightforward situations, but break down when challenged.

For example:

- Maintain proper stance and grip while fighting.
- Execute basic strikes and blocks with competence.
- Nock and release arrows smoothly, hitting stationary targets.
- Throw knives, spears, or axes with basic accuracy at short range.
- Fire firearms safely, hitting man-sized targets at close range.
- Direct weak electric bolts at targets.
- Power small electronic devices with bioelectric energy.
- Absorb minor electrical currents without harm.
- Write simple programs, repair minor mechanical issues.
- Assemble small machines or gadgets with basic functionality.
- Troubleshoot and optimize low-level code and hardware.

### Journeyman (3 Successes)

Feats are established, dependable abilities. They represent solid training and refined practice, effective in most conditions and adaptable in use.

For example:

- Chain attacks into fluid, effective combos.
- Parry and counter-attack with precision.
- Fight against multiple opponents with controlled movements.
- Consistently hit moving targets with bow, thrown, or firearm.
- Reload and fire smoothly in the heat of combat.
- Curve shots around light cover or arc arrows precisely at range.
- Manipulate metal objects with magnetism.
- Channel stronger electrical arcs for offense or utility.
- Overcharge or disrupt small circuits with a touch.
- Hack into security networks, repair major systems.
- Reverse-engineer technology to improve efficiency.
- Design and construct advanced robotic or cybernetic enhancements.

### Master (4 Successes)

Feats are extraordinary displays of control. They push beyond ordinary limits, combining precision, creativity, and versatility to redefine what’s possible.

For example:

- Perform near-superhuman feats with weapons (e.g., cutting arrows in midair).
- Master fighting styles from multiple weapon traditions.
- Split an arrow or bullet already lodged in a target.
- Throw multiple knives or axes in quick succession, each hitting cleanly.
- Snipe moving targets at extreme distances with uncanny accuracy.
- Absorb and redirect lightning strikes.
- Generate electromagnetic fields to repel or attract metallic objects.
- Control localized weather patterns to summon storms.
- Control entire electrical grids and energy sources.
- Blackout or restore power to cities at will.
- Generate controlled plasma fields from raw electricity.
- Design intelligent AI, create life-supporting habitats.
- Develop fully automated industrial systems.
- Integrate organic and synthetic components seamlessly.

### Olympian (7 Successes)

Feats are mythic acts of mastery. They bend probability, momentum, and circumstance in your favor, often producing results that defy logic.

For example:

- Deflect bullets with a sword or energy blade.
- Intuitively predict opponents’ strikes before they happen.
- Handle any melee weapon with perfect control and mastery.
- Deflect incoming missiles with your own shots.
- Fire while moving acrobatically without loss of precision.
- Loose arrows or bullets that ricochet off surfaces to strike hidden foes.
- Pin opponents to walls with a single well-placed shot.
- Control entire electrical grids and energy sources.
- Blackout or restore power to cities at will.
- Generate controlled plasma fields from raw electricity.
- Code software that predicts human behavior perfectly.
- Construct self-repairing structures and adaptive machines.
- Design smart cities that autonomously regulate themselves.


### Demigod (10 Successes)

Feats are world-shaping powers. They turn battles, collapse systems, or alter entire environments. Each use has sweeping impact.

For example:

- Move faster than the eye can track while striking.
- Deliver blows that can split reinforced armor.
- Battle entire squads without sustaining injury.
- Rain down volleys of arrows that blot out the sky.
- Fire projectiles that punch through multiple armored foes.
- Throw a spear across a battlefield to strike a commander through their guard.
- Every shot finds the most vulnerable point in armor, no matter the angle.
- Overload any device or power system.
- Disrupt communication networks with electromagnetic pulses.
- Convert energy into different forms, such as heat, motion, or light.
- Build sentient AI that can evolve over time.
- Develop self-replicating nanotechnology.
- Engineer machines capable of independent innovation and adaptation.

### Lesser Deity (14 Successes)

Feats are cosmic-scale dominions. They extend across vast distances and dimensions, overwhelming barriers that would stop any lesser technique.

For example:

- Destroy entire battlefields with a single swing.
- Use melee strikes to cleave through spacecraft hulls.
- Fight at supersonic speeds with no loss of control.
- Cut through energy fields, magic barriers, and force fields effortlessly.
- Thrown weapons can cross miles and still strike the target.
- Projectiles curve through time and space to hit any enemy you can name.
- Shots pierce magical wards, energy shields, or dimensional barriers.
- Manipulate the electromagnetic spectrum of an entire solar system.
- Control solar flares and coronal mass ejections from stars.
- Reshape planets by altering their core energy fields.
- Reshape stars using pure energy manipulation.
- Create self-sustaining stellar machines.
- Sever interdimensional connections with a blade.
- Command entire fleets using integrated neural circuits
- Subsume an entire global network into your consciousness via neural link
- Hack into a national power grid and completely disable it
- Control global weather patterns with magic rituals

### Elder Deity (18 Successes)

Feats are reality-defining truths. They no longer operate as techniques but as principles — universal laws that bend existence to your will.

For example:

- With a thought, all weapons in the universe become an extension of your being.
- All arrows in existence fly at your command.
- Throw weapons and strike foes on other worlds.
- Fire so perfectly that the concept of "distance" ceases to matter—every shot hits.
- Forge cosmic storms that span the universe.
- Control the flow of energy across galaxies without limit.
- Transcend physical form, existing as pure electromagnetic force.
- Forge entire universes as computational constructs.
- Develop technology that masters control of both space and time on a galactic scale

Zone Movement
==================
Zones are arbitrary divisions of the map defined as the distance most characters can cover by moving for one [Beat](#Time).

If they do nothing else besides move, characters may move two Zones in one [Beat](#Time).

Characters with magical or technological augmentation may move faster or slower.

If the GM is using maps, it is expected that they divide them into Zones, or otherwise enforce Zone Movement when applicable.

A Note on Differing Movement Speeds
-----------------------------------------
If all parties are roughly the same speed, the GM is encouraged to make the Zones larger. For instance, during a chase between two motorcycles, the GM might make zones that take up an entire city block so that all characters can still move roughly one zone per [Beat](#Time).

**If characters are traveling at significantly different speeds,** the GM can draw smaller zones inside the larger ones. For instance: if a character suddenly dismounts their motorcycle during the chase, the GM can quickly delineate some smaller zones inside of the larger ones.

If the GM finds themselves having to draw too large or too small, they can feel free to run the action using two different maps at different scales.

| 7       | Moment           | A brief but significant point in time within a Beat, often influencing its direction. |
| 8       | Instant          | An event that happens immediately.                                                    |

Flashbacks
------------
GMs may give out Flashbacks to players that they may use later.

At any time, characters may choose to spend a Flashback in order to remember a scene that happened in the past. They might remember that they packed certain equipment or planned ahead for a specific contingency that they're facing.

Flashbacks are still full scenes that can have major consequences on the progression of the sequence. Characters must roll for any Feats that they attempt, and deduct gold for any equipment they remember purchasing.

Flashbacks are not time travel. They can add additional past events, but they cannot cancel out past events that have already happened. If characters incur damage during the flashback, it manifests in the present, or the flashback simply fails to make any effect. This is particularly true if a character dies in a flashback.

# Playing Multiple Characters

With GM permission, a player may control more than one character simultaneously, such as a wizard and their fighter bodyguard.

## **Rules for Multiple Characters:**

- **Distinct Roles:** Each character should have a unique function in the party to prevent redundancy.
- **Balanced Spotlight:** The GM should ensure that a single player does not dominate the game, allowing all players equal engagement.
- **Action Economy:** When controlling multiple characters, a player must manage their actions fairly, ensuring each character follows initiative order appropriately.
- **Character Cohesion:** If playing multiple characters, they should have a reason to work together, whether through bonds, employment, or shared goals.
- **GM Discretion:** The GM may impose limits, such as preventing players from running more than two characters at once or restricting additional characters to support roles.

This rule allows for more flexible storytelling and party compositions, ensuring each player can contribute to the game in a meaningful way.

## **Playing an Entire Group**
In some cases, a single player may control an entire group of characters, such as a mercenary squad, a noble and their retainers, or a wizard and their summoned creatures.

### **Rules for Controlling a Group:**
- **Group Identity:** The characters should function as a **cohesive unit**, with shared goals and a logical reason to act together.
- **Streamlined Actions:** To keep gameplay smooth, the player should resolve group actions efficiently, such as rolling for multiple characters simultaneously when appropriate.
- **Tactical Limitations:** The GM may enforce rules on how many actions a player can take per round to avoid overwhelming the turn structure.
- **Narrative Balance:** The GM should ensure that a group-controlled player does not overshadow other players.
- **Resource Management:** Group-controlled players must track **individual stamina, health, and abilities** separately to maintain balance.

This system allows for more diverse storytelling opportunities, especially in campaigns where lone heroes with loyal followers play a central role.

---

## **Playing an Entire Domain**
Players may occasionally gain control over a domain that might be as small as a village or as large as a galaxy. These have their own rules, summarized under the section on [Domain Level Play](#Domain-Level-Play)
## **Solo Play**
In some cases, a player may wish to take on the role of both the **player and the GM**, running an entire game by themselves. This allows for personalized storytelling, experimentation, and world-building.

### **Rules for Solo Play:**
- **Structured Improvisation:** Since the player is also the GM, they should establish loose guidelines and tools (random tables, oracle decks, or AI-assisted prompts) to generate unexpected challenges.
- **Self-Limiting Mechanics:** To maintain balance, the player should follow standard rules for action economy, combat, and skill checks without favoring their character.
- **Journaling & Logs:** Keeping a session journal helps track progress, world changes, and character development.
- **Randomization & Uncertainty:** Using dice rolls or external resources (such as solo RPG engines) can prevent predictable outcomes and keep the game engaging.
- **Multiple Perspectives:** The player may control different factions, switching viewpoints to create organic conflict and dynamic storytelling.

Solo play provides a way for players to explore narratives at their own pace, experiment with world-building, and refine gameplay mechanics without needing a traditional group setup.

Domains
==========
Overview
----------
At higher levels of play, characters might gain control over Domains—kingdoms, factions, corporations, or empires. This system allows players to engage in large-scale politics, warfare, economics, and diplomacy while preserving Atomic D6's streamlined mechanics.

Each Domain has a Level (0-10), Aspects, and Holdings that define its strengths and weaknesses. Domain actions are taken in Domain Turns, which typically represent one season (3 months), one month, or one cycle depending on the setting.

Domain Feats are useful in order to determine how large events unfold in the background of the game, and between sequences. For instance: to determine whether an invasion succeeds, the attacker and defender can roll a single opposed check.

---
Gaining Control of a Domain
--------------------------------
Characters may assume control over a Domain in various ways, depending on the game's narrative and setting. Here are some common paths to Domain leadership:

### 1. Inheritance & Bloodlines
- A character may inherit a Domain through noble birth, royal succession, or familial legacy.
- The transition of power may be smooth or contested, requiring political maneuvering or even military force.

### 2. Military Conquest
- A Domain may be seized through force of arms, either by leading an army or orchestrating a coup.
- Conquest may lead to resistance, uprisings, or logistical challenges in maintaining control over the new territory.

### 3. Political Intrigue & Manipulation
- Characters skilled in diplomacy, espionage, or blackmail may rise to power through political games.
- Gaining favor with key factions, eliminating rivals, or forging alliances can shift the balance of power.

### 4. Religious or Ideological Authority
- A character may lead a Domain by being the head of a major faith, cult, or revolutionary movement.
- Spiritual influence or ideological fervor can unite people under a leader’s vision, granting control over a Domain.

### 5. Economic Domination
- Control over trade, resources, or financial institutions can allow a character to dominate a region.
- Merchant princes, crime lords, or industrial magnates can use wealth to buy power, fund armies, or topple rulers.

### 6. Divine or Supernatural Intervention
- A character may gain a Domain by receiving divine mandate, mystical power, or otherworldly backing.
- Gods, ancient spirits, or eldritch entities may bestow rulership upon a worthy (or cursed) individual.

### 7. Democratic or Popular Election
- In some societies, rulers are elected by councils, senates, or the will of the people.
- Winning an election or leading a popular movement can grant legitimate control over a Domain.

### 8. Founding a New Domain
- A character may carve out a new Domain in unclaimed or hostile lands.
- This could involve settling a colony, uniting scattered factions, or leading a nomadic horde to glory.

Gaining control over a Domain often comes with challenges, including rival factions, internal instability, and external threats. Players must navigate these obstacles to maintain and expand their rule.

---
Regents, Ministers, and Managers
--------------------------------------
Leaders that wish to go out on adventures must leave someone in charge of their Domain. It goes without saying that this requires a great deal of trust.

During each Domain Turn, leaders may issue standing orders to their Ministers, who will (usually) execute them to the best of their ability.

If leaders are out of communication, their Ministers will follow standing orders and do their best to react to situations as they arise.

Gaining Aspects from Domains
---------------------------------
When a character is part of a Domain (such as a Faction, Kingdom, or Guild), they can gain an Aspect that represents their role, rank, and influence within that Domain.

These Aspects change how people react to the character. They might grant Bonuses or Maluses in relevant situations, and they might allow characters access to new resources.

| Aspect Example                    | Bonus                                  | Malus                                    |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "Knight of the Sun Court"         | when negotiating with nobility         | when dealing with criminal organizations |
| "Member of the Alchemist’s Guild" | to crafting potions                    | when bartering outside the guild         |
| "Crimson Blades Enforcer"         | to intimidation in mercenary contracts | when dealing with nobility               |

### Changing Domain Aspects
- Promotion or Demotion: Characters may gain or lose ranks within a Domain, altering their Aspects.
- Defection or Betrayal: Leaving a Domain may replace the Aspect with something negative (e.g., "Exiled from the Sun Court").
- Multiple Domain Aspects: A character may belong to multiple Domains, but they might find it increasingly difficult to manage split allegiances.

By treating Domains as living, evolving entities, these Aspects help shape how characters interact with the world and how the world reacts to them.

Progression of Domains
--------------------------
A Domain's Level represents the scope of its influence.

| Modifier | Scope of Power | Examples                                      |
|----------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| +0       | Powerless      | A failed kingdom, outlawed cult, exiled noble |
| +2       | Local          | A village, minor guild, small mercenary band  |
| +4       | Province       | A large city or province                      |
| +6       | Kingdom        | A nation, a large faith, a military order     |
| +9       | Empire         | A realm controlling multiple nations          |
|----------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| +14      | Planetary      | A planetary empire, a world religion          |
| +20      | Interstellar   | An interstellar republic, a galactic megacorp |
| +26      | Galactic       | A civilization spanning multiple galaxies     |

Domain Turns
--------------
Domain Turns happen in-between Sequences, when characters have downtime.

1. Players declare Domain Feats.
2. GM sets difficulty
3. Players roll Feat Dice Domain + Atomic D6 for the entire Domain.
4. Outcomes are resolved, GM calls for Players to roleplay scenes if necessary.
5. GM Rolls to determine random Domain Events

Domain Feats vs. Individual Feats
---------------------------------------
In Atomic D6, characters can issue orders to the other members of their organization. Giving orders is a feat of communication in and of itself. After the regent, minister, or manager of the domain receives the orders, they (usually) execute them to the best of their ability.

When the orders get passed down, the underlings of the Domain execute them. This second Feat is called a Domain Feat. In order to determine the success or failure of a Domain Feat, the players or DM use the same logic that applies to Atomic D6 characters: If the Feat is relevant to the Concept of the Domain, they may apply their Concept Bonus to the roll.

Domain Feats by Approximate Level
---------------------------------------
#### +0 Powerless (Failed / Scattered Band)

Feats are unreliable or impossible. The collective lacks organization and cannot act meaningfully at scale.

- Struggle to provide food and shelter.
- Vulnerable to outside threats without coordination.
- Cannot build or defend infrastructure reliably.
- Survival depends on luck or outside aid.

#### +2 Village

Feats are simple, functional collective efforts. They work reliably in straightforward conditions but break down under large-scale stress.

- Feed and shelter a small population.
- Defend against bandits or wild beasts.
- Build basic fortifications (palisades, watchtowers).
- Craft weapons and tools for survival.
- Organize hunting, farming, or herding at subsistence levels.

#### +4 City-State

Feats are established and dependable. They represent an organized society capable of coordinating people and resources.

- Maintain trade routes and regional roads.
- Field professional militias or small armies.
- Establish marketplaces and cultural centers.
- Build ships, mines, or workshops at scale.
- Withstand sieges or regional disasters.

#### +6 Kingdom

Feats are extraordinary at the scale of nations. They push beyond ordinary limits and display creativity, versatility, and control.

- Wage wars across borders.
- Establish cities, universities, and guilds.
- Shape culture, laws, and religious movements.
- Build wonders of the world (cathedrals, castles, colossal statues).
- Develop bureaucracies to manage large populations.

#### +9 Empire

Feats are mythic acts of mastery at the civilizational scale. They bend probability and momentum in favor of an entire people.

- Conquer and integrate diverse cultures.
- Control trade and communication across continents.
- Build vast navies or armies with near-limitless reach.
- Shape religions or ideologies to unify millions.
- Construct early megastructures (Great Walls, sprawling aqueduct systems).

#### +14 Planet

Feats are world-shaping acts. They alter environments, ecosystems, and societies permanently.

- Terraform regions to suit needs.
- Mobilize billions for planetary projects.
- Establish orbital defenses and interplanetary reach.
- Harness planetary-scale energy sources (fusion grids, massive reactors).
- Build structures visible from space (orbital elevators, supercities).

#### +20 Interstellar

Feats extend across solar systems. They overwhelm barriers that would stop any lesser collective.

- Colonize multiple star systems.
- Build fleets capable of interstellar dominance.
- Harvest stars for energy (Dyson swarms).
- Coordinate economies spanning light-years.
- Rewrite stellar cartography through exploration and conquest.

#### +26 Galactic

Feats are reality-defining at the largest civilizational scale. They reshape existence for all under their control.

- Dictate galactic trade, law, or culture.
- Build megastructures around entire stars.
- Re-engineer galactic phenomena (wormholes, black holes).
- Manipulate entire species’ evolution across millennia.
- Rewrite history or culture at a galactic scale.

### Example Domain Sheet

The people live under heavy taxation and constant surveillance.

### Rebel Raids

Skirmishes between loyalists and the usurper’s forces threaten stability.

### Arcane Imbalance

The ancient magics of the Silverwood grow restless, causing unpredictable
effects.

### Foreign Intrigue

Neighboring kingdoms eye Veyndor’s weakened state, considering intervention or
conquest.

# Worldbuilding Through High-Level Play
## The Setting as a Living Narrative

In Atomic D6, the campaign world is not static: it is a Narrative, just like the events unfolding in play. Instead of starting with a pre-built setting, players can create the world dynamically by taking on the roles of divine beings, primordial forces, or legendary founders. Through Domain Level Play, they may shape history, establish civilizations, and define the world's fundamental laws, all while telling an evolving story.

## Playing as an Elder Deity

_"That is not dead which can eternal lie... and with strange aeons even death may die."_ - H.P. Lovecraft

Elder Deities take turns called Primordial Aeons.

In the Primordial Aeons, the Elder Deities can create or modify any one of the Atomic Elements:

- Cosmology
  - Natural and Magical Laws
  - Lesser Deities
- Planetology
- Geography
- Species
- History and Prehistory:
    - Domains
        - Cultures
        - Nations
        - Factions
        - Religions
    - Characters
        - Motivations
        - Conflicts
    - Periods
    - Events

Elder Deities can add Atomic Elements to the beginning, middle, or end of history at any time during the Primordial Aeons.

Atomic Elements cannot be removed from the game once they are introduced, however, they can be killed or destroyed by historical events introduced later.

---

## Game Setting

When they reach a consensus, or a predetermined number of Primordial Aeons, the Elder Deities may decide to begin the next phase of the game.

Based on the setting that they created, the Elder Deities work with the players in order to determine the time period and location of the beginning of the game.

After that, players will need to work with the GM to determine their starting level, and create characters with Concepts rooted in the setting that they created.

# Why is this game called Atomic D6?

The Atom is the smallest stable unit found in nature, but despite its small size, the Atom contains a great deal of potential energy, and it can be combined into many different forms. [The Five Mutually Reenforcing Design Principles of Atomic D6](#The-Five-Mutually-Reenforcing-Design-Principles-of-Atomic-D6) seek to embody those qualities.

---

# The Five Mutually Reenforcing Design Principles of Atomic D6
## Fun

Above all else, we will strive to make our rules fun, even at the expense of our other design principles.

## Speed

A faster game is an exciting game, and exciting games are fun.

## Simplicity

We will strive to do more with less, which will make our game faster to understand and play.

## Extensibility

We will prefer open-ended rules that can be extended by players and the community, which will help us do more with less.

## Scalability

We will prefer rules that can handle a wide range of power levels and situations consistently, which will help keep things simple.
