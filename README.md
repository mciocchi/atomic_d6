# Example Character Sheet

```
# Kaelion Veynor (3)

Stamina:
[x] [x] [ ]

Wounds:

♡ Slashed arm
♡
♡

## **Concept:** Cursed Prince Seeking Redemption

Exiled heir to a once-prosperous kingdom, forced to wander after a betrayal by
his closest ally.

## **Heritage:** Half-Elf

Agile and keen senses, but ostracized by both human and elven societies.

## **Strength:** Unyielding Will

Kaelion refuses to falter, pushing through pain, exhaustion, and even magical
influence. His sheer determination grants him resistance against mind-affecting
effects and allows him to keep fighting even when gravely wounded. However, his
unwillingness to retreat, stubbornness in diplomacy, and disregard for limits
can lead to unnecessary risks, conflicts, or self-destruction. His allies may
rely on him too much, and his refusal to yield may cost him dearly when wisdom
calls for caution.

## **Bond:** Loyal to his younger sister

The last surviving member of his family.

## **Flaw:** Haunted by Guilt

Struggles to trust others and often second-guesses his actions.

## **Fighting Style:** Swordsman

Renowned for precise and deadly swordplay, Kaelion was trained to wield a sword
from a young age.

## **The Mark of Ruin**

A magical curse symbol on his arm. Once per session, Kaelion can invoke it for
a significant magical effect, but it also causes unpredictable side effects.

---

## **Inventory**

  - Enchanted Longsword, *Moonshade*
    – Grants Bonuses in low-light conditions.

  - Reinforced Leather Armor
    – Provides moderate protection without sacrificing mobility.

  - Journal filled with sketches of his kingdom’s history and cryptic notes.
  - A medallion belonging to his sister, imbued with faint protective magic.
  - Small pouch of herbs for treating minor wounds.

```

# What is an Aspect?

**Aspects are things that a character has.** As long as a character has an Aspect, it is true. If the Aspect ceases to be true, or if the character no longer has it, it is removed from their sheet.

An Aspect can provide Bonuses in some situations and Maluses in others.

For example: Kaelion gets bitten by a zombie, which grants him a Wound Aspect called "Bitten leg." which grants him a Malus to movement and agility.

Later on, Kaelion might show his bitten leg to a shopkeeper in order to garner sympathy and get a Bonus to negotiate a better price on a Healing Potion.

# Character Creation

Fill out the following sections of your Character Sheet during creation:

## Starting Aspects

Each character starts with **seven core Aspects** that define them. The following Aspects are recommended, but GMs and Players may decide to start with different ones.

A character's Aspects grant them a bonus or a detriment to any skills that are relevant, and over the course of the game, they will gain new ones as their character changes over time.

1. **Concept**: A broad statement about who your character is at their core. This could be as simple as "Wandering Scholar" or as specific as "Cursed Prince Seeking Redemption."

2. **Background**: Your character’s history and past experiences. Where are they from? What key events shaped them?

3. **Heritage**: The culture and species your character hails from. This can grant traits, societal expectations, or inherited abilities.

4. **Strength**: A defining strength or talent that your character possesses, whether physical, mental, or emotional. This is something they can rely on in challenging situations.

5. **Bond**: A significant relationship or connection that holds meaning for your character. It could be a person, a group, or an ideal they hold dear.

6. **Flaw**: A weakness or shortcoming that makes your character more realistic. Flaws drive tension in the narrative and create interesting story opportunities.

7. **Fighting Style**: What skills the character relies upon in combat.

---

# Character Progression

Characters in Atomic D6 get broader and taller. As they progress through the story, characters acquire new Aspects, and some of their old Aspects may be superseded.

As time passes, GM may decide that characters "level up," which represents their skills increasing over time. As characters level up, things that used to be difficult become trivial.

Some feats and knowledge that may be difficult or impossible to achieve in a medieval setting might become trivial in a modern setting.

It is recommended that the GM limit the number of Aspects a player can have to about 10.

## **Scaling System for Atomic D6 Abilities**

Each level represents a **significant increase in power**, ranging from **everyday minor abilities** to **reality-shaping cosmic feats.**

### **0 - Untrained (Default Human Ability)**

- Actions reflect the **basic, everyday skills** of an average person.
- Example: Lighting a campfire, riding a bicycle, fixing a leaky faucet.

### **1 - Apprentice (Basic Trained Ability)**

- The lowest level of **formal training or practice** in a skill.
- Example: Sailing a small boat in calm waters, casting a simple magical light.

### **2 - Journeyman (Proficient Ability)**

- Represents a **solid foundation of skill** with a few years of experience.
- Example: Leading a small militia, performing minor surgery, piloting a fighter jet.

### **3 - Master (Exceptional Ability)**

- The **peak of human skill** in a given area, possessed by **one in a million**.
- Example: Performing brain surgery, leading a major army, forging legendary weapons.

### **4 - Olympian (Pinnacle of Human Ability)**

- The highest **human** level of skill, with **only one person per country** reaching this tier.
- Example: Winning a world war single-handedly, creating a flawless AI system.

### **5 - Demigod (Superhuman Abilities)**

- Abilities **exceed all mortal limits**, comparable to mythic heroes.
- Example: Dodging bullets, seeing the future, commanding armies with divine charisma.

### **6 - Titan (Continental Scale)**

- Actions impact **entire continents**, **altering terrain, climate, or governance.**
- Example: Raising a mountain range, ruling an empire effortlessly.

### **7 - Seraph (Planetary Scale)**

- Influence spans an **entire planet**, reshaping its environment or politics.
- Example: Terraforming Mars, controlling the thoughts of entire populations.

### **8 - Lesser Deity (Solar System Scale)**

- Power **reshapes entire solar systems** or dictates the fate of planets.
- Example: Moving planets into alignment, creating a sentient star.

### **9 - Deity (Galactic Scale)**

- Influence extends **across galaxies**, controlling cosmic forces.
- Example: Engineering new life forms across multiple worlds, altering spacetime itself.

### **10 - Elder Deity (Universal Scale)**

- Power extends across **the entire universe**, with absolute reality control.
- Example: Creating entirely new physical laws, manifesting parallel universes.

# Rolls
Whenever players attempt to do something, the GM decides their chance of success, from *Awful* to *Superb*, and grants them a number of D6. Players also roll the *Atomic D6*, which determines if they receive a Boon or a Bane.

If the roll is considered trivial or impossible, a roll is usually not needed unless the GM explicitly calls for it.

## Feats Scale Infinitely

Rolls are always relative. Depending upon the scope and scale of the story, a roll might be used to represent the outcome of a fistfight between two peasants or two Elder Gods colliding, their contrary realities radiating eldritch energies incomprehensible to man as they attempt to annihilate one another. In either one of these cases, the opponents are roughly equivalent, so the GM rules that the characters only need to roll 1D6 to determine the outcome of the situation.

That's the power of the Atomic D6 Narrative Dice System: relative rolls allow the game to scale infinitely without requiring more calculation.

## Skill Dice

### Variant Rule: Atomic D20

Some players feel an attachment to the D20, and they can't imagine playing Tabletop RPGs without it. These players may use the following table to convert their rolls into D20 instead of D6.

| Result | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 11-20  | Success     |
| 1-10   | Failure     |

| **Difficulty:**   | **Die to Roll:** | **Bonus:** | **Level Difference:**     | **% Success:** |
|:------------------|:-----------------|:-----------|:--------------------------|:---------------|
| Trivial           | Don't roll       | +5         | More than 2 levels lower  | > 90           |
| Superb            | 1D20+8           | +4         | 2 levels lower            | 90             |
| Excellent         | 1D20+6           | +3         |                           | 80             |
| Great             | 1D20+4           | +2         | 1 level lower             | 70             |
| Good              | 1D20+2           | +1         |                           | 60             |
| Middling          | 1D20+0           | +0         | Equivalent                | 50             |
| Poor              | 1D20-2           | -1         |                           | 40             |
| Bad               | 1D20-4           | -2         | 1 level higher            | 30             |

| Terrible          | 1D20-8           | -4         | 2 levels higher           | 10             |
| Nearly Impossible | Don't roll       | -5         | More than 2 levels higher | < 10           |

## The Atomic D6
| **Roll:** | **Description:** |
|-----------|------------------|
| 5-6       | Boon             |
| 3-4       | Nothing          |
| 1-2       | Bane             |

Whilst Skill Dice represent a character's ability, the Atomic D6 represents the narrative forces of chaos and fate, and everything outside of their control.

In certain situations where many rolls are happening back to back, the GM may call for only one Atomic D6 for the sake of speed and simplicity.

### Variant Rule: "There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."

Some groups don't like the randomness that the Atomic D6 adds to the game. Others might want to substitute their own GM Oracle. In that case, they may choose to play without the Atomic D6.

### Understanding the Atomic D6 in Context with Skill Rolls

| **Description:** | **Result:**       |
|------------------|-------------------|
| "Yes, and..."    | Success with Boon |
| "Yes."           | Success           |
| "Yes, but..."    | Success with Bane |
| "No, but..."     | Failure with Boon |
| "No."            | Failure           |
| "No, and..."     | Failure with Bane |

## Attempting a Feat

Azrick the Bard is attempting to ingratiate himself with Lord Axebender in an attempt to gain access to his private collection of tomes. He hopes that one of the books will reveal the last known location of a powerful magic artifact. He decides to perform a ballad in front of the court.

Azrick's character sheet states that his Concept is "Traveling Minstrel" and he has "Musician" as his Strength, so the GM grants him 2 Bonuses (+2), one for each relevant Aspect.

Azrick is an Apprentice Bard, which means he's level 2, and the song he's attempting to perform is also about as difficult as an Apprentice can play (level 2.) Because he's attempting a Feat of equal level to his own, his chance of success neither increases nor decreases, and remains at +2.

Unless the GM specifies otherwise, +2 grants Azrick two additional dice, up to 3D6, which means his chance of success is "Great."

Azrick rolls 4,3, Success! Everyone claps, and Lord Axebender has been convinced to grant him access to his library!

"Bravo! We haven't had a Minstrel at court for quite some time. It's been too long, really."

## Attempting a Feat of Higher Level

Lord Axebender stroked his beard and looked Azrick up and down. "There's an old tune I remember from my youth. I think it was called 'The Verse of the White Rose.' Do you know it? Won't you please play it for me?"

Azrick knew the tune, but it was advanced. Usually those techniques were only learned during the Journeyman (Level 3) years of Minstrelsy.

"Yes my lord, it's known to me." Sweating, nervous, Azrick began to pluck his lute, and he rolled 5, 2, Success with Bane.

The music flowed perfectly, his mind was completely clear, his fingers jumping into the right chords without even a thought, and just then, right when he thought he was safe, Azrick heard a voice in the crowd.

"You played the refrain. That's how they play it in Castburia, but you don't have the accent, so what gives?" A middle-aged man wearing a fine doublet, with a silver ponytail behind a chiseled face emerged from the crowd.

"My Lord, how do we know this man wasn't sent by the Castburians to spy upon us?"

Azrick's Success with Bane has guaranteed his place at court, but at a cost; he has a new rival!

---

# Contests

A Contest is a roll that compares the skill of one or more characters that are trying to use their abilities to oppose one or more other characters.

In such a case, the GM is expected to adjust the relative difficulty of the roll to account for the skill of the opposing party. During two-sided contests, only one party needs to roll because the failure of one party causes the opposing party to succeed.

The fact that only one party needs to roll gives the GM some flexibility because rolls can be initiated and resolved by either party.

The winner of a contest is usually able to do what they attempted, but there may be additional consequences for both the loser and the winner, especially if they rolled a Boon or a Bane.

## **Contest Example: Grappling**
- A **warrior** attempts to grapple an opponent.
- The warrior has 1 relevant Aspect, so he receives +1
- He's also one level higher than his opponent, which gets an additional +2.
- His opponent also has +1, which gets subtracted because he's in opposition.
- The warrior rolls 2D6 Keep Highest **2, 5** **Best Roll: 5 (Success!)**
- **He successfully grapples his opponent.**
- The Atomic D6 roll is **1 (Bane effect triggered!).**
- **Outcome:** The warrior successfully grapples the opponent but **overextends and they both fall prone!**

---

# Group Rolls

Occasionally the GM and players may decide that a single roll is not enough to capture the nuance of a situation where the whole group is attempting to perform a single task.

In this case, the GM can call for a Group Roll, where each member of the group rolls, and if the majority succeeds, the group is considered to have succeeded.

For the sake of speed and simplicity, only one Atomic D6 should be rolled during a Group Roll.

## Group Contests

Usually opposing actions between groups are resolved by a single Contest roll, but the GM could also opt for a Group Roll if they want to engage all the players.

A Group Contest is run the same way as a Group Roll, but the GM must adjust the difficulty of each players roll to take the skill of the opposition into account.

Only the members of one of the groups need to roll because their failure implies that the opposition won.

If the majority of the players succeed on their rolls, the group wins the Contest.

## "Battle Royale" Contests

On rare occasion, three or more individuals or groups are all competing against one another. In this case, the GM may call for repeated rounds of rolls. Anyone who fails gets eliminated from the contest. The rounds of rolls continue until only one winning party remains, or until all parties have been eliminated.

As is the case with other Group Contests, only one Atomic D6 should be rolled during a Battle Royale.

---

# Notice / Stealth Rolls

Characters can make a Notice roll to determine whether they sense something. A character trying to Notice a target is initiating a contest against the target's Stealth.

When determining the difficulty of a Notice or Stealth roll, the GM should consider the following factors:
* Stealth of the target
* How alert is the observer?
* How noisy is the environment?
* Is the target actively trying to Stealthy?
* How good are the senses of the observer?
* Training and experience (for instance- Rangers receive Bonuses in wilderness environments)
* How much time is the observer spending trying to Notice the target?

**Noticing Inanimate Objects** works the same way, with some additional considerations that should be taken into account by the GM:

If the object has been crafted to be hidden or camouflaged, the GM can take the craftsman's skill into account when determining the difficulty of the contest.

**Group Stealth / Notice Rolls**

If an entire group of characters is attempting to Notice or Stealth, the rules for group contests apply.

Incapacitated characters automatically fail Notice Rolls.

---

# Reaction Rolls

The GM can call for a Reaction Roll in order to determine whether characters have time to respond to a threat.

Characters that fail to Notice a threat automatically fail their Reaction Roll to it.

Incapacitated characters automatically fail Reaction Rolls.

---

# Turn-Based Play

In certain situations where many things are happening at once and time is essential, the GM may decide that turn-based play is needed. Turn-based play is not necessarily limited to combat, but it is frequently used that way.

It is recommended that GMs begin turn-based play with a Reaction Contest in order to determine which party acts first.

By default, when it is the players turn to act, they take turns around the table clockwise, but they may also decide to use an alternate turn order to coordinate their actions.

## 1) Players take Action

When a player announces their action, the GM assigns them a number of Skill Dice and tells them to keep the highest or lowest based on the difficulty of what they're attempting to do.

When players attack an NPC, the GM should take these factors into consideration when setting the difficulty of the Skill Roll:

- Range of the target
- Armor
- Resistances and Immunities
- Target's level and ability to take Defensive Actions
- Target's level of alertness
- Cover
- Other mitigating factors

If the player succeeds on their roll, their attack is successful. A failure means their attack missed or was negated by their opponent's actions. A failure with Bane might even grant the enemy an immediate counterattack.

Players may move either before or after they attack. A typical mortal can move one zone per combat turn without augmentation, but if they do nothing else, they may move two zones.

Players may also speak in turn-based play, but they are limited to ten syllables per turn.

## 2) Players Defend

Notably, Atomic D6 is different from other popular TTRPG systems in that it is asymmetric. NPCs usually do not roll to defend or attack. The players roll. This is in accordance with the Atomic D6 philosophy of eliminating excess rolls wherever possible.

On the NPCs turn, the GM may move them and declare their actions.

When NPCs attack, the players roll to defend. If the players fail, the attack succeeds. Whether players are attacking or defending, it bears repeating that there is only one roll. Either the attacker or the defender rolls, but usually not both.

Players may decide what kind of defensive action to take, for instance, they may dodge, block, parry, hide, counterspell, or even a Judo throw, and they're encouraged to be creative when narrating their actions.

Each of these actions have different difficulties depending upon the defender's situation, skills, and opponent.

For each additional attacker after the first that characters must defend against, they receive an additional Malus on their defensive rolls.

### Counterspell
A Counterspell is bound by all of the same rules as any other magic spell. They are different only with regards to the fact that they are cast by a defender and they cannot take longer than one defensive turn to cast.

A Counterspell does not simply cancel out enemy offensive actions: they are full fledged spells that defend by adding additional effects. For instance, an Aquamancer might summon a shield made of water to simultaneously block and extinguish an enemy fireball.

### Defending someone else

In melee, a typical character may attempt to defend any other character within the same zone, with the knowledge that they are risking life and limb in the process.

Casters may attempt to counterspell an attack more than one zone away, but in that case, they are bound by the rules of ranged attacks.

### Suggestions for Defensive Actions:
- **Dodge** Jump out of the way.
- **Block** Stop the attack with a shield.
- **Parry** Knock the enemy's attack away with your weapon. Usually doesn't work against projectiles.
- **Counterspell** Cast a spell to try to negate an enemy attack.
- **Judo Throw** Use the force of the enemy attack to try to throw them with Martial Arts.
- **Cover** Hit the deck or duck behind something or someone
- **Something else** Be creative!

---

# Quick Skirmishes

If the story warrants that a combat should be resolved quickly, the GM determines the difficulty of the entire battle and resolves it with a single roll.

As an alternative, the GM may allow each player to roll in order to decide their fate during the battle and determine how much they had to exert themselves.

Large-scale battles between armies can be resolved as a series of quick skirmishes.

---

# Stamina, Wounds, and Scars

Most mortals begin the game with one Stamina and two Wound Slots.

Player characters are heroes with supernormal abilities, and they usually start with three Stamina and three Wound Slots.

## Stamina

When a character takes damage, they lose Stamina. Consuming Stamina in this way represents a character getting the wind knocked out of them, or expending their energy to take evasive action.

At the GM's discretion, some actions like sprinting or concentrating for a long period of time are particularly taxing and may also consume Stamina.

### Eating and Drinking

Characters recover Stamina naturally by sleeping or taking 30 minutes of light activity to eat and drink.

At that point, they may roll for each point of Stamina that they have lost. Characters usually receive +4 to recover Stamina in this way, but that may change depending upon the quality of the rations and how they were prepared.

## Wounds

Wounds represent damage to a character which can be either physical or mental.

When characters take damage and they have no more Stamina to lose, they take a Wound.

### Sleep

Wounds have a chance to heal naturally after characters have slept for eight hours.

Upon waking, characters roll for for each Wound they have, in order to determine if it has healed, and they receive +2. At this time, characters may also receive +5 (success guaranteed) to recover Stamina, but these Bonuses may vary in the case of poor or interrupted sleep.

## Scars

If characters accumulate two Wounds in the same location or suffer a particularly grievous injury, they receive a Scar.

Scars are Aspects of a character that have lingering effects, including long-term psychological damage, broken bones, amputation, bleeding, or infection.

Most scars do not heal naturally and require specialized treatment in order to be removed.

## Physical Scars

The exact type of scar depends upon the type of physical damage that caused it.

| **D6** | **Location** |
|--------|--------------|
| 1      | Foot         |
| 2      | Hand         |
| 3      | Leg          |
| 4      | Arm          |
| 5      | Torso        |
| 6      | Head / Neck  |

## Mental Scars

## Variant Rule: No Major Wounds

If the players and GM decide to forego realism in the pursuit of fun, they may play the game without Major Wounds.

---

## A note on Cybernetic, post-human, or alien species

Not all species eat and sleep in the same way that humans do.

Instead of eating and sleeping, cybernetic organisms are assumed to be rebooting, charging, and performing maintenance protocols.

Likewise, instead of medicine, these species may require repair.

The exact rules for different species can be handled on a case-by-case basis.

---

# Death

When all of a character's Wounds have been used, they begin to die, and they may choose how to spend their last breaths:

## Inspiring last words

You are mortally wounded, but your death need not be in vain. You use your last burst of energy to utter rousing last words which grant all allies within hearing distance a Boon which they may use however they wish within the next ten minutes.

## Adrenaline

You take your last breaths and adrenaline keeps you functioning and grants you a Boon to use however you want. In addition, you take an extra turn right at this moment. At the end of that turn, you die, regardless of any healing you receive.

## Critical Condition

You become incapacitated and focus all your energy on staying alive. Roll D6 at this moment, and at the beginning of each subsequent turn until you die or return to consciousness:

| D6:  | Result:                                                           |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 6:   | Against all odds, you regain a heart and return to consciousness. |
| 4-5: | Survive for another turn.                                         |
| 1-3: | Slip into the abyss and die.                                      |

If you receive medical attention while you are incapacitated, you may make this roll with +1.

### Death by Mental Wounds

In Atomic D6, Mental Wounds are considered to be just as deadly as physical ones. When a character dies due to Mental Wounds, their body remains in tact, but their personality is destroyed by the gravity of the cosmic horrors that they have witnessed. They are unresponsive, unable even to eat or drink, and nothing short of a magical or technological miracle can bring them back.

# Story Points
Story Points allow players some control over the narrative.

GMs are encouraged to make their own tables detailing ways that characters can earn Story Points.

# Spellcasting

"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." ~~**Arthur C. Clarke**

Magic in *Atomic D6* is a **freeform, narrative-driven system.** Casters are allowed to declare any spell effect, as long as it's within their area of expertise.

## **Casting a Spell**

1. **Declare the Spell Effect** – The player describes the spell they want to cast.
2. **GM Consults [Ability Examples by Discipline](#Ability-Examples-by-Discipline)** And determines difficulty based on power, range, situation, and opponent's ability to resist.
3. **Roll Skill Dice** – The caster rolls their relevant magic skill (e.g., **Pyromancy 3D6, Keep Highest**).
4. **Roll the Atomic D6** – Determines if a **Boon** or **Bane** applies.
5. **Resolve Effect**
   - **Success with Boon**: The spell works better than intended.
   - **Success**: The spell works as expected.
   - **Success with Bane**: The spell succeeds, but with an unexpected drawback.
   - **Failure with Boon**: The spell fails to do what the caster intended, but instead, something beneficial happens.
   - **Failure**: The spell fails with no additional effects.
   - **Failure with Bane**: The spell fails and has unintended negative consequences.

---

## **Magic Costs & Limitations**

To prevent overuse and encourage **strategic spellcasting**, *Atomic D6* uses the following **cost and risk mechanics**:

### **1. Stamina Drain**

- **By default, spells only cost Stamina when they fail.**
- If a caster reaches **0 Stamina**, they can keep casting, but **each failed spell inflicts a Wound**.

### **2. Boons & Banes Create Consequences**

- A **Bane** can introduce **unexpected side effects**, even on a success.
- **High-tier magic with Banes** can be catastrophic.

### **3. Variant Rule: Pay Stamina on Success**

- Instead of costing Stamina **only on failure**, GMs may rule that **spells only drain Stamina on success**.
- **Each spell costs 1 Stamina** by default.

### **4. Magical Overload (Overcasting)**

- If a caster **fails a spell while at 0 Stamina**, they suffer **a Wound**.
- This represents **magical backlash, exhaustion, or psychic strain** from pushing too far.

### **5. Narrative Magic Limits**

- The GM may introduce **story-driven magic restrictions**, such as:
  - **Rare components** required for advanced spells.
  - **Societal consequences** for public magic use.
  - **Mystical conditions** that must be met to perform legendary spells.
  - **Divine Patronage** required to channel magic power

---

### **6. Paradox**
Magic is still mysterious and poorly understood. It has been observed that occasionally, the same exact spell will get more difficult when cast repeatedly.  Other spells that seem to break the laws and expectations of the universe also experience this phenomenon.

Wizards who have experienced this describe it as the universe exerting its own will and pushing back against a paradoxical situation that should not be happening.
## **Spellcasting Examples by School of Magic**

Below are example spells at different power levels, showcasing **how spell resolution works** using the Atomic D6 system.

### **Chronomancy (Level 0 – Untrained)**

#### **Spell: "Hesitation"**

*Briefly slow a target’s reflexes, making them sluggish for a moment.*

| Result                | Effect                                                   |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Success with Boon** | The target hesitates longer than expected,               |
|                       | giving the caster’s allies a bonus on their next action. |
| **Success**           | The target loses a split second, stumbling slightly.     |
| **Success with Bane** | The target is slowed, but the caster also suffers a      |
|                       | brief lapse in concentration.                            |
| **Failure with Boon** | The spell fizzles, but the target becomes slightly       |
|                       | distracted anyway.                                       |
| **Failure**           | The target shrugs off the attempt.                       |
| **Failure with Bane** | The spell rebounds slightly, making the caster           |
|                       | hesitate instead.                                        |

---

### **Stormcalling (Level 3 – Journeyman)**

#### **Spell: "Thunder Lance"**

*Summon a concentrated bolt of lightning to strike a single target.*

| Result                | Effect                                                |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Success with Boon** | The lightning arcs into nearby enemies, hitting a     |
|                       | secondary target.                                     |
| **Success**           | The target is struck by the lightning bolt.           |
| **Success with Bane** | The lightning hits, but the shockwave knocks the      |
|                       | caster slightly off balance.                          |
| **Failure with Boon** | The bolt misses, but it startles the target.          |
| **Failure**           | The spell misfires, sending static into the air.      |
| **Failure with Bane** | The lightning misfires, striking an unintended object |
|                       | or ally.                                              |

---

### **Gravetomancy (Level 6 – Demigod)**

#### **Spell: "Event Horizon"**

*Create a localized gravitational field that pulls everything toward a single point.*

| Result                | Effect                                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Success with Boon** | The pull is stronger than expected, distorting light   |
|                       | and sound.                                             |
| **Success**           | The field manifests, dragging objects and enemies      |
|                       | toward the center.                                     |
| **Success with Bane** | The spell works, but the caster is slightly affected,  |
|                       | slowing their own movements.                           |
| **Failure with Boon** | The field fails to form, but the area becomes slightly |
|                       | heavier, slowing enemies.                              |
| **Failure**           | The spell fizzles, doing nothing.                      |
| **Failure with Bane** | The field inverts, pushing everything outward in an    |
|                       | unintended shockwave.                                  |

---

### **Psychomancy (Level 8 – Seraph)**

#### **Spell: "Mindweb"**

*Link multiple minds together, allowing them to share thoughts and instincts.*

| Result                | Effect                                                |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Success with Boon** | The linked minds gain heightened awareness, allowing  |
|                       | perfect coordination.                                 |
| **Success**           | The spell works, allowing telepathic communication.   |
| **Success with Bane** | The link is unstable, causing minor confusion.        |
| **Failure with Boon** | The spell fails, but a brief telepathic echo provides |
|                       | useful insight.                                       |
| **Failure**           | The magic does not take hold.                         |
| **Failure with Bane** | The link is unstable, causing mental distress.        |

---

### **Spatiomancy (Level 10 – Elder Deity)**

#### **Spell: "Infinite Collapse"**

*Fold space inward, creating a singularity that devours all in its range.*

| Result                | Effect                                                  |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Success with Boon** | The singularity is stable, and the caster can           |
|                       | precisely control it.                                   |
| **Success**           | Space folds inward, erasing a massive portion of the    |
|                       | battlefield.                                            |
| **Success with Bane** | The spell works, but an unintended rift lingers,        |
|                       | causing instability.                                    |
| **Failure with Boon** | The collapse fails, but the warping effect disorients   |
|                       | enemies.                                                |
| **Failure**           | The caster attempts to fold space, but nothing happens. |
| **Failure with Bane** | The spell backfires, creating a gravitational anomaly   |
|                       | that disrupts the battlefield.                          |

| 2      | Narrative        | A full campaign, typically spanning one to five   |
|        |                  | Acts.                                             |

## Flashbacks:

At any time, characters may choose to spend a Story Point in order to remember a scene that happened in the past. They might remember that they packed certain equipment or planned ahead for a specific contingency that they're facing.

Flashbacks are still full scenes. Characters must roll for any feats that they attempt and deduct gold for any equipment they remember purchasing.

---

# Playing Multiple Characters

With GM permission, a player may control more than one character simultaneously, such as a wizard and their fighter bodyguard.

## **Rules for Multiple Characters:**

- **Distinct Roles:** Each character should have a unique function in the party to prevent redundancy.
- **Balanced Spotlight:** The GM should ensure that a single player does not dominate the game, allowing all players equal engagement.
- **Action Economy:** When controlling multiple characters, a player must manage their actions fairly, ensuring each character follows initiative order appropriately.
- **Character Cohesion:** If playing multiple characters, they should have a reason to work together, whether through bonds, employment, or shared goals.
- **GM Discretion:** The GM may impose limits, such as preventing players from running more than two characters at once or restricting additional characters to support roles.

This rule allows for more flexible storytelling and party compositions, ensuring each player can contribute to the game in a meaningful way.

---

## **Playing an Entire Group**
In some cases, a single player may control an entire group of characters, such as a mercenary squad, a noble and their retainers, or a wizard and their summoned creatures.

### **Rules for Controlling a Group:**
- **Group Identity:** The characters should function as a **cohesive unit**, with shared goals and a logical reason to act together.
- **Streamlined Actions:** To keep gameplay smooth, the player should resolve group actions efficiently, such as rolling for multiple characters simultaneously when appropriate.
- **Tactical Limitations:** The GM may enforce rules on how many actions a player can take per round to avoid overwhelming the turn structure.
- **Narrative Balance:** The GM should ensure that a group-controlled player does not overshadow other players.
- **Resource Management:** Group-controlled players must track **individual stamina, health, and abilities** separately to maintain balance.

This system allows for more diverse storytelling opportunities, especially in campaigns where lone heroes with loyal followers play a central role.

---

## **Playing an Entire Domain**
Players may occasionally gain control over a domain that might be as small as a village or as large as a galaxy. These have their own rules, summarized under the section on [Domain Level Play](#Domain-Level-Play)
## **Solo Play**
In some cases, a player may wish to take on the role of both the **player and the GM**, running an entire game by themselves. This allows for personalized storytelling, experimentation, and world-building.

### **Rules for Solo Play:**
- **Structured Improvisation:** Since the player is also the GM, they should establish loose guidelines and tools (random tables, oracle decks, or AI-assisted prompts) to generate unexpected challenges.
- **Self-Limiting Mechanics:** To maintain balance, the player should follow standard rules for action economy, combat, and skill checks without favoring their character.
- **Journaling & Logs:** Keeping a session journal helps track progress, world changes, and character development.
- **Randomization & Uncertainty:** Using dice rolls or external resources (such as solo RPG engines) can prevent predictable outcomes and keep the game engaging.
- **Multiple Perspectives:** The player may control different factions, switching viewpoints to create organic conflict and dynamic storytelling.

Solo play provides a way for players to explore narratives at their own pace, experiment with world-building, and refine gameplay mechanics without needing a traditional group setup.

# Domains
## **Overview**
At higher levels of play, characters might gain control over **Domains**—kingdoms, factions, corporations, or empires. This system allows players to engage in large-scale **politics, warfare, economics, and diplomacy** while preserving Atomic D6's streamlined mechanics.

Each Domain has a **Level (0-10), Aspects, and Holdings** that define its strengths and weaknesses. Domain actions are taken in **Domain Turns**, which typically represent **one season (3 months), one month, or one cycle** depending on the setting.

---
## **Gaining Control of a Domain**
Characters may assume control over a Domain in various ways, depending on the game's narrative and setting. Here are some common paths to Domain leadership:

### **1. Inheritance & Bloodlines**
- A character may inherit a Domain through **noble birth, royal succession, or familial legacy**.
- The transition of power may be smooth or contested, requiring political maneuvering or even military force.

### **2. Military Conquest**
- A Domain may be seized through **force of arms**, either by leading an army or orchestrating a coup.
- Conquest may lead to **resistance, uprisings, or logistical challenges** in maintaining control over the new territory.

### **3. Political Intrigue & Manipulation**
- Characters skilled in **diplomacy, espionage, or blackmail** may rise to power through political games.
- Gaining favor with key factions, eliminating rivals, or forging alliances can shift the balance of power.

### **4. Religious or Ideological Authority**
- A character may lead a Domain by **being the head of a major faith, cult, or revolutionary movement**.
- Spiritual influence or ideological fervor can unite people under a leader’s vision, granting control over a Domain.

### **5. Economic Domination**
- Control over **trade, resources, or financial institutions** can allow a character to dominate a region.
- Merchant princes, crime lords, or industrial magnates can use wealth to buy power, fund armies, or topple rulers.

### **6. Divine or Supernatural Intervention**
- A character may gain a Domain by **receiving divine mandate, mystical power, or otherworldly backing**.
- Gods, ancient spirits, or eldritch entities may bestow rulership upon a worthy (or cursed) individual.

### **7. Democratic or Popular Election**
- In some societies, rulers are **elected by councils, senates, or the will of the people**.
- Winning an election or leading a popular movement can grant legitimate control over a Domain.

### **8. Founding a New Domain**
- A character may **carve out a new Domain** in unclaimed or hostile lands.
- This could involve settling a colony, uniting scattered factions, or leading a nomadic horde to glory.

Gaining control over a Domain often comes with challenges, including **rival factions, internal instability, and external threats**. Players must navigate these obstacles to maintain and expand their rule.

---
## **Regents, Ministers, and Managers**
Leaders that wish to go out on adventures must leave someone in charge of their Domain. It goes without saying that this requires a great deal of trust.

During each Domain Turn, leaders may issue standing orders to their Ministers, who will (usually) execute them to the best of their ability.

If leaders are out of communication, their Ministers will follow standing orders and do their best to react to any situations that arise.

## **Gaining Aspects from Domains**
When a character is part of a Domain (such as a Faction, Kingdom, or Guild), they can gain an Aspect that represents their role, rank, and influence within that Domain.

These Aspects change how people react to the character. They might grant **Bonuses** or **Maluses** in relevant situations, and they might allow characters access to new resources.

| **Aspect Example**                    | **Bonus**                                 | **Malus**                                   |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **"Knight of the Sun Court"**         | +1 when negotiating with nobility         | -1 when dealing with criminal organizations |
| **"Member of the Alchemist’s Guild"** | +1 to crafting potions                    | -1 when bartering outside the guild         |
| **"Crimson Blades Enforcer"**         | +1 to intimidation in mercenary contracts | -1 when dealing with nobility               |

### **Changing Domain Aspects**
- **Promotion or Demotion**: Characters may gain or lose ranks within a Domain, altering their Aspects.
- **Defection or Betrayal**: Leaving a Domain may replace the Aspect with something negative (e.g., *"Exiled from the Sun Court"*).
- **Multiple Domain Aspects**: A character may belong to multiple Domains, but they might find it increasingly difficult to manage split allegiances.

By treating Domains as living, evolving entities, these Aspects help shape how characters interact with the world and how the world reacts to them.

## **Domain Levels**
A Domain's **Level** represents its scale and influence.

| **Level** | **Scope of Power** | **Examples**                                  |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **0**     | Powerless          | A failed kingdom, outlawed cult, exiled noble |
| **1**     | Local              | A village, minor guild, small mercenary band  |
| **2**     | Regional           | A barony, growing noble house, city-state     |
| **3**     | Province           | A large city or province                      |
| **4**     | Kingdom            | A nation, a large faith, a military order     |
| **5**     | Empire             | A realm controlling multiple nations          |
| **6**     | Continental        | A force controlling an entire continent       |
| **7**     | Planetary          | A planetary empire, a world religion          |
| **8**     | Stellar            | An interstellar republic, a galactic megacorp |
| **9**     | Galactic           | A civilization spanning star systems          |
| **10**    | Universal          | A pantheon shaping reality itself             |

## **Domain Turns**

Domain Turns happen in-between sessions, when characters have downtime.

The GM may also run any number of Domain Turns before starting a Narrative, as a world building exercise.

1. **Players declare their Domain Actions.**
2. **GM sets difficulty** based on scale and opposition.
3. **Players roll Domain Skill Dice + Atomic D6.**
4. **Outcomes are resolved, GM calls for Players to roleplay scenes if necessary.**
5. **GM Rolls to determine random Domain Events**

---
## **Domain Actions**
Because the rules of Atomic D6 can scale infinitely, Domain Actions are resolved by the same mechanics as individual actions. Domains can attempt Feats and Contests just like an individual or small group can.

- **For each level the acting Domain is higher, it gains +2.**
- **For each level the acting Domain is lower, it suffers -2.**
- If a Domain has a beneficial Aspect relating to the roll, they gain +1
- Detrimental Aspects grant -1

Domains can take actions in key areas:

### **1. Political Actions**
- **Enact a Law** (Change policies, taxation, criminal justice)
- **Suppress or Support a Faction** (Control nobles, guilds, or rebels)
- **Stabilize the Realm** (Quell unrest, inspire loyalty)
- **Espionage** (Sabotage enemies, steal secrets)

### **2. Diplomatic Actions**
- **Form or Break Alliances** (Forge treaties, betray factions)
- **Negotiate Trade Deals** (Improve economy, secure rare goods)
- **Influence Foreign Powers** (Sway rivals, back rebels)
- **Declare War or Peace** (Shift strategic focus)

### **3. Economic Actions**
- **Expand Industry & Trade** (Create infrastructure, boost commerce)
- **Extract Resources** (Mine, tax, harvest resources)
- **Invest in Projects** (Build fortresses, establish academies)
- **Control Key Trade Hubs** (Seize ports, set tariffs)

### **4. Military Actions**
- **Raise or Disband Armies** (Recruit or dissolve military forces)
- **Launch an Invasion** (Seize new territory)
- **Defend a Territory** (Fortify and prepare for war)
- **Train or Reform the Army** (Improve strategy and discipline)

### **5. Cultural & Religious Actions**
- **Promote or Suppress Religion** (Expand or persecute faiths)
- **Patronize the Arts** (Shape cultural identity)
- **Shape Education & Knowledge** (Advance science, philosophy, or magic)
- **Control or Defy Prophecies** (Manipulate myths and legends)
