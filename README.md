# Aspects

**Aspects are things that a character has.** As long as a character has an Aspect, it is true. If the Aspect ceases to be true, or if the character no longer has it, it is removed from their sheet.

### Boons and Banes

A Boon is a beneficial Aspect which grants characters an extra dice that they can add to their skill checks in certain situations. The size of the dice depends upon the [Skill Level](#difficulty-scaling) of the Character.

Banes are the opposite of Boons. Banes are detrimental Aspects of a character that subtract dice from their roll, depending upon their situation.

Tertius is a Journeyman, which means his dice size is d8. If he receives a Boon, he rolls:

    1d20+1d8

In shorthand, we can express this as:

    1B

If Tertius receives a Bane and no Boons, he rolls:

    1d20-1d8

Which we shorten to simply:

    -1B

If Tertius is rolling a Skill Check in a situation where he has neither Boon nor Bane, he rolls:

    1d20 + 0d8

Which we may shorten to simply:

    0B

This shorthand will be used frequently in this guide.

### Aspects can be either a Boon or a Bane, depending upon the situation

Tertius has burns on his face, which are an Aspect of his character.

Depending upon the situation, the DM might rule that Tertius' wound may grant him -1B to charm people, but +1B if he wishes to intimidate them.

In some situations, based on the ruling of the DM, Aspects not relevant, or not significant enough to influence the outcome of a Skill Check. In that case, they are not added to the roll.

### Aspects can be Passive or Active

There are times when it is not appropriate for players to roll dice in a Skill Check. In those cases, we consider Boons to be equivalent to their average value, rounded down. We add the Boons together and add 10 (the average of d20 rounded down). The active party rolls their Skill Check against this passive score.

    Passive Score = Average Boons rounded down + 10

| Skill Level: | 1B (Passive) = |
|--------------|----------------|
| Untrained    | 2              |
| Apprentice   | 3              |
| Journeyman   | 4              |
| Master       | 5              |
| Olympian     | 6              |
| Lesser Deity | 600            |
| Deity        | 6000           |
| Elder Deity  | 60000          |

#### Armor and Equipment

**The size of the Boon granted by Equipment is based upon the skill of the person who crafted it**, rather than that of the person who wields it.

For example, Armor grants characters Passive Boons to defense:

| Description: | Defense (B): | Dodge (B): | Spellcasting (B): |
|--------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| Unarmored    | 0            | 1          | 0                 |
| Light        | 1            | 0          | -1                |
| Heavy        | 2            | -1         | -2                |

Tertius' Plate and Mail armor was crafted by an Apprentice Blacksmith with 2B in Smithing. It's also Heavy, which grants an additional 2B to defense:

    Plate and Mail Passive Defense = 10 + (Craftsman's Smithing Skill, 2d4) + (Heavy Armor Bonus, 2d4)

OR:

    18 = 10 + 4 + 4

#### Armor
#### Equipment
#### Perception / Stealth
#### Ambushes

### Concept

***A character's Concept is a specific type of Aspect that encapsulates what they are.*** A Concept doesn' have to be about combat. It could be a profession, a vocation, or something else.

When Tertius was a young man, he pledged fealty to the Order of the Ossuary to become a Black Knight. He chose it as his life path, and so it became his character's Concept.

He has progressed to the level of a Journeyman, which means he has earned three Boons, equivalent to 3D8. Tertius placed two of those into his Concept, which means he can add an additional 2D8 to any rolls that he makes that relate to his experience as a Black Knight.

### Expertise

Within his studies as a Black Knight at the Order of the Ossuary, Tertius Dabbled in Necromancy. Knowledge of the Necromantic arts is something that Tertius has, so it's another Aspect of his character.

Tertius receives a Boon to casting Necromantic spells because of his Aspect. He's a Journeyman, so the boon is 1D8.

As an important sidenote: the Black Knight Concept does not include spellcasting, so it does not grant Tertius a Boon in that regard.

It goes without saying that by splitting his training between spellcasting and melee, Tertius will not be as powerful as characters that focus only on spellcasting or only on melee.

DMs are advised to avoid allowing overly broad character Concepts in their game. This can allow characters to apply their Concept bonus to both melee and spellcasting, which tends to create hybrid characters that are overpowered. For this reason, Tertius cannot apply his Black Knight Concept to his Necromantic spells.

### Equipment

Tertius' equipment is something that he has, so it's another Aspect of his character.

Equipment is special because it doesn't progress like other Aspects. When Tercius went from an Apprentice to Journeyman Black Knight, his Boon Dice went from D6 to D8 as his skills sharpened with experience. Despite that, his equipment stayed the same.

He still fights with the axe that he trained with. The weaponsmith was an Apprentice, and so the axe adds a boon of D6 to the 2D8 that he gets from his Concept.

In general, the Boon granted by weapons and equipment is dependent upon the Boon of the craftsman at the time they were created.

### Situation

# Practiced Maneuvers

In Atomic D20, any character may attempt anything, but success is never guaranteed.

By taking an hour to practice maneuvers at the beginning or end of the day, characters may improve their chances of success and receive a Boon.

Practiced Maneuvers are distinct from Aspects because they're something that characters do, not something that they have. The other requirement of Practiced Maneuvers is that they have to be specific, rather than general.

Characters have limited time to practice Maneuvers, but they can practice more as they become more efficient with experience.

As a Journeyman, Tercius can practice and grant himself a Boon in three specific maneuvers per day. He practices trip attacks, summoning skeletons, and summoning bone javelins.

Tercius can attempt to do anything, but he gains an extra boon in these three Maneuvers over and above those granted by his other Aspects.

# Dynamic Character Creation

Dynamic Character Creation throws characters into the middle of the action. PCs begin their first session playing "Untrained" characters.

The PCs don't need to decide how many Expertise Boons they have in any skill until the moment they use that skill.

When PCs use a skill, before they roll, the DM prompts them to determine how many Expertise Boons (if any) they want to allocate into it.

Players may allocate two Expertise Boons in this way. They may take a third Expertise Boon in exchange for taking a Bane in something else.

Over the course of the first session, players are also expected to decide their heritage and find weapons and equipment. The DM should work with the players to make sure they find the kind of weapons and equipment that they need. Heritage does not need to be decided until it affects the narrative.

The first session usually ends with players having a much better idea regarding their Concept. At the end of the session, the DM can choose to allow the PCs to level up to Apprentice (D6) and at that time, they may pick a Concept that sums up the broad idea of what they want their character to be.

At the time they pick their Concept, PCs may choose to clarify and refine their Expertise Boons to make sure they fit. After that, they're fixed, and they usually don't change again without DM permission.

Players should spend all their Expertise Boons if they have managed to level up to Apprentice without doing so already.

# Quick Character Creation

Before the story starts, players work with the DM to choose:
1) Concept
2) Heritage
3) 2 Expertise Boons or 3 Expertise Boons and 1 Bane
4) Starting Equipment

Players start the first session of the game as Apprentices.

# Character Progression

As the story progresses, the DM grants the players additional Expertise Boons which they may allocate as they see fit.

When the players reach significant milestones in the story, the DM may decide that they have leveled up, at which point, the size of their Boon Dice increases.

# TODO Adjusting story difficulty

# TODO Spellburn Resistance?

Spells are a particular kind of maneuver which involve bending the rules of the universe itself.

Spellburn
-----------
Bending the rules of the universe to one's will is not without its cost. Spells differ from other maneuvers in that when a spell fails, the caster loses some of their life force. Players take severe (2d6) damage each time a spell fails.

TODO: Spellburn only on failure, or on every cast?

Paradox
---------
Magic is still mysterious and poorly understood. It has been observed that occasionally, the same exact spell will get more difficult when cast repeatedly.  Other spells that seem to break the laws and expectations of the universe also experience this phenomenon.

Wizards who have experienced this describe it as the universe exerting its own will and pushing back against a paradoxical situation that should not be happening.

# Health and Wounds

Characters have two kinds of health on their sheet. The state of a character's body is represented by hearts.

A Character's Stamina is represented by a pair of lungs.

Most humanoids have one unit of Stamina and three Hearts, but this is not necessarily always true. 

Stamina is special because it can be consumed in place of Hearts. Consuming Stamina in this way represents a character expending their energy to take evasive action. In addition, some actions like sprinting or concentrating for a long period of time are particularly taxing and they may also consume Stamina.

Minor Wounds
------------
If 9 damage or less is inflicted upon a character, they receive a Minor Wound. Minor physical wounds represent cuts and bruises, and they consume one Heart or Stamina.

Minor mental wounds represent things like anxiety, depression, and trauma, and they consume one Heart.

A Minor Wound in a particularly annoying place might incur a temporary Bane upon the character whenever they attempt to use that body part.

Major Wounds
------------
When a character takes 10 or more damage, they receive a Major Wound. Major wounds consume two units of physical or mental health and they always cause a Bane.

Major Wounds may be permanent, or they may take as few as 7 days to heal. A particularly bad wound like an amputated limb might even render the affected body part completely nonfunctional.

When all of a character's Hearts are consumed, they begin to [die](#death).

Nonlethal Damage
----------------
Characters may choose to specify that they are attempting to deal nonlethal damage. At that point, their target becomes unconscious instead of dying when all of their Hearts are consumed.

Attacks with firearms and certain spells cannot be made nonlethal, but most blunt melee attacks can.

Wound Locations
---------------
Wounds are localized to specific parts of a character's anatomy. If a character receives one as the result of an attack or failed maneuver, the DM may use the result of that roll in order to determine its location as long as it makes narrative sense.

|D20 result:|Wound Location:|

Healing
-------
A character's Stamina recovers after a half hour rest without strenuous activity.

For each Minor Wound that they have, Characters may make a DC 8 check when they wake up each morning to determine whether the wound is healed.

Characters must wait until the morning of the seventh day in order to roll to heal a Major Wound. The DC to heal a Major wound is 14. 

Just because a wound has healed does not necessarily mean its effects are completely gone.

TODO How does magical / alchemical healing work?

# Death

When all of a character's wound slots are filled, they begin to die, and they may choose how to spend their last breaths:

Inspiring last words
--------------------
You are mortally wounded, but your death need not be in vain. You use your last burst of energy to utter rousing last words which grant all allies within hearing distance a Boon which they may use however they wish within the next ten minutes.

Adrenaline
----------
You take your last breaths and adrenaline keeps you functioning and grants you a Boon to use however you want. In addition, you take an extra turn right at this moment. At the end of that turn, you die, regardless of any healing you receive.

Miraculous Recovery
-------------------
You become incapacitated and focus all your energy on staying alive. Roll d20 this turn and on each subsequent turn until you die or return to consciousness:
| D20:   | Result:                                                          |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 19-20: | Against all odds, you regain a heart and return to consciousness |
| 11-18: | Survive for another turn                                         |
| 1-10:  | Slip into the abyss and die                                      |

Q: Can you have Armor Skill?
Q: Should Armor Scale?
What about the disadvantages of armor? Those should also scale.
A: That's why we deal with Boons and Banes instead of raw numbers. Boons and Banes scale, and raw numbers don't.

Heavy Armor:
Medium Armor:
Light Armor:
Unarmored:

Maybe armor and items shouldn't scale? In this paradigm, players would be forced to craft items and go out into the world to find them.

Nevertheless, the effect remains the same. In that case, the armor scales up and the player does not.

Apprentice crafted Heavy Armor receives an Apprentice level Major Boon to defense. It also provides an Apprentice level Major Bane to Spellcasting and Stealth.

Done deal.

Penalties for Heavier Armor
---------------------------
- Heavier armor has a higher chance of causing a Spell Failure.
- Heavier armor gives penalties to sneaking
- Penalties to stamina

Q: Should Boons be able to be stacked, or should they cap off at Major?

Items complicate character scaling tremendously by stacking Boons.

Consider: Players are always going to find ways to stack bonuses and break the system. The parties that want to do that will gravitate to that sort of behavior. Don't worry about it. Instead, just make sure there is no single dominant strategy and the system scales gracefully.

# Why is this game called Atomic D20?

The Atom is the smallest stable unit found in nature. Despite its small size, it contains a great deal of potential energy, and it can be combined into a multitude of different forms. In that sense, this game seeks to embody the qualities of its namesake.

# The Five Mutually Reenforcing Design Principles of Atomic D20

#### Fun
Above all else, we will strive to make our rules fun, even at the expense of our other principles.

#### Speed
A faster game is an exciting game, and exciting games are fun.

#### Simplicity
We will strive to do more with less, which will make our game faster to understand and play.

#### Extensibility
We will prefer open-ended rules that can be extended by players and the community, which will help us do more with less.

#### Scalability
We will prefer rules that can handle a wide range of power levels and situations consistently, which will help keep things simple.
