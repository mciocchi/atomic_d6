## What is an Aspect?

**Aspects are things that a character has.** As long as a character has an Aspect, it is true. If the Aspect ceases to be true, or if the character no longer has it, it is removed from their sheet.

An Aspect can provide Bonuses in some situations and Maluses in others.

For example: Kaelion gets bitten by a zombie, which grants him a Wound Aspect called "Bitten leg." which grants him a Malus to movement and agility.

Later on, Kaelion might show his bitten leg to a shopkeeper in order to garner sympathy and get a Bonus to negotiate a better price on a Healing Potion.

## Character Creation

Fill out the following sections of your Character Sheet during creation:

### Starting Aspects

Each character starts with **seven core Aspects** that define them. The following Aspects are recommended, but GMs and Players may decide to start with different ones.

A character's Aspects grant them a bonus or a detriment to any skills that are relevant, and over the course of the game, they will gain new ones as their character changes over time.

1. **Concept**: A broad statement about who your character is at their core. This could be as simple as "Wandering Scholar" or as specific as "Cursed Prince Seeking Redemption."

2. **Background**: Your character‚Äôs history and past experiences. Where are they from? What key events shaped them?

3. **Heritage**: The culture and species your character hails from. This can grant traits, societal expectations, or inherited abilities.

4. **Strength**: A defining strength or talent that your character possesses, whether physical, mental, or emotional. This is something they can rely on in challenging situations.

5. **Bond**: A significant relationship or connection that holds meaning for your character. It could be a person, a group, or an ideal they hold dear.

6. **Flaw**: A weakness or shortcoming that makes your character more realistic. Flaws drive tension in the narrative and create interesting story opportunities.

7. **Fighting Style**: What skills the character relies upon in combat.

## Character Progression

Characters in Atomic D6 get broader and taller. As they progress through the story, characters get new Aspects, and some of their other Aspects may be replaced by new ones.

As time passes, GM may decide that characters "level up," which represents their skills increasing over time. As characters level up, things that used to be difficult become trivial.

Some feats and knowledge that may be difficult or impossible to achieve in a medieval setting might become trivial in a modern setting.

It is recommended that the GM limit the number of Aspects a player can have to about 10.

## Rolls
Whenever players attempt to do something, the GM decides their chance of success, from *Awful* to *Superb*, and grants them a number of D6. Players also roll the *Atomic D6*, which determines if they receive a Boon or a Bane.

If the roll is considered trivial or impossible, the GM may declare that a roll is not needed.

Rolls are always relative. Depending upon the scope and scale of the story, a roll might be used to represent the outcome of a fistfight between two peasants or two Elder Gods colliding, their contrary realities radiating eldritch energies incomprehensible to man as they attempt to annihilate one another. In either one of these cases, the opponents are roughly equivalent, so the GM rules that the characters only need to roll 1D6 to determine the outcome of the situation.

That's the power of the Atomic D6 Narrative Dice System: relative rolls allow the game to scale infinitely without requiring more calculation.

## Contests

A Contest is a roll that compares the skill of one or more characters that are trying to use their abilities to oppose one or more other characters.

In such a case, the GM is expected to adjust the relative difficulty of the roll to account for the skill of the opposing party. During two-sided contests, only one party needs to roll because the failure of one party causes the opposing party to succeed.

The fact that only one party needs to roll gives the GM some flexibility because rolls can be initiated and resolved by either party.

The winner of a contest is usually able to do what they attempted, but there may be additional consequences for both the loser and the winner, especially if they rolled a Boon or a Bane.

| Description                                             | Die to Roll      | Approximate |
|                                                         |                  | Level       |
|                                                         |                  | Difference  |
|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------|
| You effortlessly overpower an unskilled foe.            | Don't roll       | > 2         |
| You face someone far below your skill level.            | 5D6 Keep Highest | 2           |
| You have a clear advantage over your opponent.          | 4D6 Keep Highest |             |
| You are superior in skill, and have the edge.           | 3D6 Keep Highest | 1           |
| You are slightly better, but success is not guaranteed. | 2D6 Keep Highest |             |
| You are evenly matched; the outcome is uncertain.       | 1D6              | 0           |
| Your opponent has a slight edge over you.               | 2D6 Keep Lowest  |             |
| Your opponent is noticeably stronger.                   | 3D6 Keep Lowest  | 1           |
| You are completely outclassed.                          | 4D6 Keep Lowest  |             |
| You face a far superior opponent.                       | 5D6 Keep Lowest  | 2           |
| You are hopelessly outmatched.                          | Don't roll       | > 2         |

### **Contest Example: Grappling**
- A **warrior** attempts to grapple an opponent.
  - The GM assigns the **warrior 3D6 (keeping the highest)** based on their comparative skill.
- The **warrior rolls:** **2, 4, 5** ‚Üí **Best Roll: 5 (Success!)**
- **The opponent fails to resist and is grappled.**
- The Atomic D6 roll is **1 (Bane effect triggered!).**
- **Outcome:** The warrior successfully grapples the opponent but **overextends and falls prone.**

## Group Rolls

Occasionally the GM and players may decide that a single roll is not enough to capture the nuance of a situation where the whole group is attempting to perform a single task.

In this case, the GM can call for a Group Roll, where each member of the group rolls, and if the majority succeeds, the group is considered to have succeeded.

For the sake of speed and simplicity, only one Atomic D6 should be rolled during a Group Roll.

### Group Contests

Usually opposing actions between groups are resolved by a single Contest roll, but the GM could also opt for a Group Roll if they want to engage all the players.

A Group Contest is run the same way as a Group Roll, but the DM must adjust the difficulty of each players roll to take the skill of the opposition into account.

Only the members of one of the groups need to roll because their failure implies that the opposition won.

If the majority of the players succeed on their rolls, the group wins the Contest.

### "Battle Royale" Contests

On rare occasion, three or more individuals or groups are all competing against one another. In this case, the GM may call for repeated rounds of rolls. Anyone who fails gets eliminated from the contest. The rounds of rolls continue until only one winning party remains, or until all parties have been eliminated.

As is the case with other Group Contests, only one Atomic D6 should be rolled during a Battle Royale.

## Notice / Stealth Rolls

Characters can make a Notice roll to determine whether they sense something. A character trying to Notice a target is initiating a contest against the target's Stealth.

When determining the difficulty of a Notice or Stealth roll, the GM should consider the following factors:
* Stealth of the target
* How alert is the observer?
* How noisy is the environment?
* Is the target actively trying to Stealthy?
* How good are the senses of the observer?
* Training and experience (for instance- Rangers receive Bonuses in wilderness environments)
* How much time is the observer spending trying to Notice the target?

**Noticing Inanimate Objects** works the same way, with some additional considerations that should be taken into account by the GM:

If the object has been crafted to be hidden or camouflaged, the GM can take the craftsman's skill into account when determining the difficulty of the contest.

**Group Stealth / Notice Rolls**

If an entire group of characters is attempting to Notice or Stealth, the rules for group contests apply.

Incapacitated characters automatically fail Notice Rolls.

## Reaction Rolls

The GM can call for a Reaction Roll in order to determine whether characters have time to respond to a threat.

Characters that fail to Notice a threat automatically fail their Reaction Roll to it.

Incapacitated characters also automatically fail Reaction Rolls.

## Turn-Based Play

In certain situations where many things are happening at once and time is essential, the GM may decide that turn-based play is needed. Turn-based play is not necessarily limited to combat, but it is frequently used that way.

It is recommended that GMs begin turn-based play with a Reaction Contest in order to determine which party acts first.

By default, when it is the players turn to act, they take turns around the table clockwise, but they may also decide to use an alternate turn order to coordinate their actions.

### 1) Players take Action

When a player announces their action, the GM assigns them a number of Skill Dice and tells them to keep the highest or lowest based on the difficulty of what they're attempting to do.

When players attack an NPC, the GM should take these factors into consideration when setting the difficulty of the Skill Roll:

- Range of the target
- Armor
- Resistances and Immunities
- Target's level and ability to take Defensive Actions
- Target's level of alertness
- Cover
- Other mitigating factors

If the player succeeds on their roll, their attack is successful. A failure means their attack missed or was negated by their opponent's actions. A failure with Bane might even grant the enemy an immediate counterattack.

Players may move either before or after they attack. A typical mortal can move one zone per combat turn without augmentation, but if they do nothing else, they may move two zones.

Players may also speak in turn-based play, but they are limited to ten syllables per turn.

### 2) Players Defend

Notably, Atomic D6 is different from other popular TTRPG systems in that it is asymmetric. NPCs usually do not roll to defend or attack. The players roll. This is in accordance with the Atomic D6 philosophy of eliminating excess rolls wherever possible.

On the NPCs turn, the GM may move them and declare their actions.

When NPCs attack, the players roll to defend. If the players fail, the attack succeeds. Whether players are attacking or defending, it bears repeating that there is only one roll. Either the attacker or the defender rolls, but usually not both.

Players may decide what kind of defensive action to take, for instance, they may dodge, block, parry, hide, counterspell, or even a Judo throw, and they're encouraged to be creative when narrating their actions.

Each of these actions have different difficulties depending upon the defender's situation, skills, and opponent.

For each additional attacker after the first that characters must defend against, they receive an additional Malus on their defensive rolls.

#### Counterspell
A Counterspell is bound by all of the same rules as any other magic spell. They are different only with regards to the fact that they are cast by a defender and they cannot take longer than one defensive turn to cast.

A Counterspell does not simply cancel out enemy offensive actions: they are full fledged spells that defend by adding additional effects. For instance, an Aquamancer might summon a shield made of water to simultaneously block and extinguish an enemy fireball.

#### Defending someone else

In melee, a typical character may attempt to defend any other character within the same zone, with the knowledge that they are risking life and limb in the process.

Casters may attempt to counterspell an attack more than one zone away, but in that case, they are bound by the rules of ranged attacks.

#### Suggestions for Defensive Actions:
- **Dodge** Jump out of the way.
- **Block** Stop the attack with a shield.
- **Parry** Knock the enemy's attack away with your weapon. Usually doesn't work against projectiles.
- **Counterspell** Cast a spell to try to negate an enemy attack.
- **Judo Throw** Use the force of the enemy attack to try to throw them with Martial Arts.
- **Cover** Hit the deck or duck behind something or someone

If the story warrants that a combat should be resolved quickly, the GM determines the difficulty of the entire battle and resolves it with a single roll.

As an alternative, the GM may allow each player to roll in order to decide their fate during the battle and determine how much they had to exert themselves.

Large-scale battles between armies can be resolved as a series of quick skirmishes.

## Wounds, Hearts, and Stamina

Most mortals begin the game with two Stamina and three Wound Slots.

When a character is hit by an attack, they receive a Wound or lose Stamina. If they have no more Stamina, they have no choice but to receive a Wound. Consuming Stamina in this way represents a character expending their energy to take evasive action.

At the GM's discretion, some actions like sprinting or concentrating for a long period of time are particularly taxing and may also consume Stamina.

Wounds can be either physical or mental. The first time players are injured in a location, they take a Minor Wound. If players are wounded in the same place again, before the Minor Wound heals, they receive a Major Wound.

Major wounds have lingering effects, including long-term psychological damage, broken bones, amputation, bleeding, or infection.

Mental wounds should not be underestimated. If a character loses their last heart due to a mental wound, they become catatonic, unable to take action or even eat, their personality having been shattered despite their body remaining in tact.

Mental wounds can also be caused by non-combat situations.

### Variant Rule: No Major Wounds

If the players and GM decide to forego realism in the pursuit of fun, they may play the game without Major Wounds.

---

## Natural Healing

Characters recover all Stamina after five minutes of low activity.

When they wake up each morning, characters roll D6 for each Minor Wound they have. On 2 or higher, the wound is healed.

Some Major Wounds cannot be healed naturally and require additional treatment.

## Spellcasting

"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." ~~**Arthur C. Clarke**

Magic in *Atomic D6* is a powerful but risky force. A character must roll **Skill Dice** to determine if their spell succeeds or fails. By default, **casters only lose Stamina when a spell fails**.

### **Casting a Spell**
1. **Determine the caster‚Äôs skill level.**
   - The GM assigns **Skill Dice** based on the caster‚Äôs expertise compared to the difficulty of the spell.
2. **Roll the assigned Skill Dice to determine success or failure of the spell.**
3. **If the spell fails, the caster loses 1 Stamina**
4. GM interprets Boons and Banes in the context of spellcasting:
  - **Boon:** The spell might have an **enhanced effect** or something beneficial happens to the caster.
  - **Bane:** The spell might **misfire or backfire**, even if successful, or something detrimental happens to the caster.

### **Running Out of Stamina**
- If a caster reaches **0 Stamina**, they **can still cast spells**, but each failure **instead deals 1 Wound.**

---

### **Variant Rule: Pay Stamina on Success** ###

In this alternate rule, **casters only lose Stamina when they successfully cast a spell**. This makes magic **more reliable but also self-limiting**, as **powerful casters burn through stamina quickly.**

- **Failure costs nothing** (but Banes may still cause side effects).
- **Success costs 1 Stamina (or more, if Overcharging).**
- **Casters must decide when to stop casting before they run out of stamina.**
- **Running out of Stamina forces Overcasting, which causes Wounds instead of Stamina loss.**

This system **encourages more frequent spellcasting** but ensures that **casters must manage their Stamina carefully.**
