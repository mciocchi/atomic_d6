## What is an Aspect?

**Aspects are things that a character has.** As long as a character has an Aspect, it is true. If the Aspect ceases to be true, or if the character no longer has it, it is removed from their sheet.

## Character Creation

Fill out the following sections of your Character Sheet during creation:

### Aspects

Each character starts with **six core Aspects** that define them. The following Aspects are recommended, but GMs and Players may decide to start with different ones.

A character's Aspects grant them a bonus or a detriment to any skills that are relevant, and over the course of the game, they will gain new ones as their character changes over time.

1. **Concept**: A broad statement about who your character is at their core. This could be as simple as "Wandering Scholar" or as specific as "Cursed Prince Seeking Redemption."

2. **Background**: Your character‚Äôs history and past experiences. Where are they from? What key events shaped them?

3. **Heritage**: The culture, lineage, or people your character hails from. This includes racial traits, societal expectations, or inherited abilities.

4. **Strength**: A defining strength or talent that your character possesses, whether physical, mental, or emotional. This is something they rely on in challenging situations.

5. **Bond**: A significant relationship or connection that holds meaning for your character. It could be a person, a group, or an ideal they hold dear.

6. **Flaw**: A weakness or shortcoming that makes your character human (or flawed in some other way). Flaws drive tension in the narrative and create interesting story opportunities.

### Skills

Characters begin their journey as **Untrained (0)** in all skills. They receive a set number of Skill Points at  creation time based on the power level of the game:

- **High Power Game**: 15 Skill Points
- **Medium Power Game (Default)**: 10 Skill Points
- **Low Power Game**: 5 Skill Points

GMs and players are encouraged to fill in the blanks and choose whatever skills they want, as long as the group agrees and they fit the setting. Nevertheless, there are a few skills that are used frequently, across many different settings, and GMs are encouraged to include them in the game by default. Those skills are listed below:

**Athletics** Determines a character's physical resilience and their ability to run, jump, and perform various feats of strength. Each of these can be chosen as sub-specialties within the same skill.

**Logic** Determines a character's mental acuity and problem solving abilities.

**Lore** Has hundreds of possible sub-disciplines that cover all kinds of book learning and received wisdom.

**Notice** Determines how likely a character is to spot things that are hidden. It is not limited to vision. Some characters may specialize in noticing particular kinds of things. For instance: a hunter specializing in "Notice / Wilderness" might receive a large bonus for spotting tracks in the wilderness and a small bonus for noticing things in general.

**Social** has many different sub-disciplines, including Bluffing, Interrogation, Leadership, Haggling, Intimidation, and Standing.

**Stealth** is what characters roll in order to avoid being **Noticed**. It also covers the use of many different types of camoflage and decoys.

**Wealth** is a special kind of skill because it increases and decreases when characters make large transactions, and it dictates what they can afford. Unlike other skills, Wealth is always general; there are no sub-skills within it because it's usually readily convertible into other forms of Wealth. In some situations, like securing a line of credit for a business idea, players may be asked to make a Wealth roll.

**Will** represents a character's mental fortitude. Strong-willed characters are more resistant to their mind being dominated and less likely to give up when their morale is low.

### Combat Skills

In addition to these default skills, players are encouraged to choose some combat skills. There are no general combat skills. Instead, players are encouraged to pick specific martial arts, like Armizare (The Medieval Art of Armaments) or Archery. In a modern setting, players might choose skills like "Military Combatives," "Brazilian Jiu Jitsu," "Firearms," "Heavy Weapons," or "Explosives." Players can choose anything, as long as the group is in agreement.

### General and specific skills
There is no "general" Magic skill, and players are encouraged to use their imagination and pick specific skills like "Necromancy" instead.

Armizare is the knightly study of the use of weaponry. Within Armizare, players may choose specific topics to focus on, such as "Armizare / Longsword"

The GM is encouraged to offer players greater bonuses for skill rolls that are within a character's area of expertise, and smaller bonuses for rolls that are only related to their broad area of study.

For example: A GM might decide to grant a character specializing in Armizare / Axes a bonus of 3D for attacking with axes. If the player decides to pick up a sword instead, the GM might rule that fencing with Swords would definitely be a part of Armizare training, even if they weren't the character's main focus. As a result, the GM might decide to grant the character a 1D bonus when fighting with swords.

## Skill Rolls
Whenever players attempt to use their skills, the GM decides their chance of success, from *Awful* to *Superb*, and awards them an appropriate number of D6. Players also roll the *Atomic D6*, which determines if they receive a Boon, Bane, or nothing.

If the Skill Roll is considered trivial or impossible, the GM may declare that a roll is not needed.

Skill Rolls are always relative, and never absolute. For example, a player may attack with a powerful magical weapon, but if their target has exceptional armor, the GM might decide their chance of a successful attack is only "Middling," and ask them to roll 1d6.

Relative skill roles are useful for resolving anything from small combats to battles between massive armies. The mechanic is still the same in a large battle. If the two sides are roughly equivalent, with the same number of advantages, the GM might rule that the player's chance of victory is still only "Middling," and they still roll just 1d6.

That's the power of the Atomic D6 Narrative Dice System: relative skill rolls allow the game to scale up infinitely with minimal calculation.

The Atomic D6
--------

| Result | Description                                       |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 5-6    | Boon, something unexpectedly good happens.        |
| 3-4    | Nothing                                           |
| 1-2    | Bane, something unexpectedly bad happens.         |

Example Attack Outcomes
--------

- **Success with Boon**: The player attacks successfully, gaining an additional benefit (e.g., catching the opponent off-balance and getting a second attack).
- **Success**: The player strikes their target successfully.
- **Success with Bane**: The player hits but leaves themselves open for counterattack.
- **Failure with Boon**: The player misses, but the enemy also falters in some way.
- **Failure**: The player misses outright.
- **Failure with Bane**: The player fails and suffers an additional setback (e.g., their weapon breaks).

## Turn-Based Combat

1) Reaction Rolls:
--------

If both parties are known to one another, the players may attempt a reaction roll. Players that succeed get to act first. Next, their opponents act. Players that failed their reaction roll get to act last.

If the players have not been detected yet, they win this reaction roll by default.

Among players that all failed or all succeeded on their reaction roll, they may decide among themselves the order that they should act. If they can't decide, clockwise around the table is a good default for most groups.

2) Players Attack
--------

When players announce their attack, the GM assigns a difficulty to their roll, and they roll the appropriate number of dice.

The difficulty of the roll should take into consideration the target's armor, their ability to parry, dodge, and resist, and any other mitigating factors. If the player succeeds on their roll, their attack is successful.

Players may move either before or after they attack. A typical Mortal can move about one zone per combat turn without magical or technological augmentation.

Players may also speak in combat, but they are limited to ten syllables per turn.

2) Players Defend
--------

On the NPCs turn, the GM may move them and declare their attacks.

When NPCs attack, the players roll to defend. If the players fail, the attack succeeds.

Within the same turn, for each attack after the first that characters must defend against, they recieve a disadvantage on all defensive rolls.

Notably, Atomic D6 is different from other popular TTRPG systems in that it is asymmetric. NPCs usually do not roll to defend or attack. The players roll. This is in accordance with the Atomic D6 philosophy. Duplicate rolls and excess calculation are eliminated wherever possible in order to speed the game.

## Quick Skirmishes

If the story warrants that a combat should be resolved quickly, the GM determines the difficulty of the entire battle and lets one player roll.

Alternatively, the GM may allow each player to roll individually in order to decide their fate during the battle and how much they had to exert themselves.

---

## Large-Scale Battles

For larger battles, like a planetary invasion, the GM may run a series of Quick Skirmishes, each requiring its own roll.

- **Example Large-Scale Battle**:
  - **Stage 1**: The player's fleet begins an orbital bombardment. The GM rules a "Fair" chance of success, allowing 2D6. They roll and get *Success with Bane*. The players destroy the planet's orbital defenses, but lose 30% of their troops, and their capital ship is damaged.
  - **Stage 2**: Landing troops. The GM decides players have a "Good" chance to succeed, since they have already destroyed most of the planet's orbital defenses. They roll and succeed without Bane or Boon.
  - **Stage 3**: Occupying the capitals. The players roll a *Failure with Boon*, meaning they capture only one capital but gain a potential ally that offers to help them seize power in exchange for acting as their planetary governor.

## Glossary

- **Boon**: A beneficial side effect, often unexpected.
- **Bane**: A detrimental side effect.
- **GM**: Game Master, the game's storyteller and referee.
- **1D**: One six-sided die.
