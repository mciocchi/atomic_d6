## What is an Aspect?

**Aspects are things that a character has.** As long as a character has an Aspect, it is true. If the Aspect ceases to be true, or if the character no longer has it, it is removed from their sheet.

## Character Creation

Fill out the following sections of your Character Sheet during creation:

### Aspects

Each character starts with **six core Aspects** that define them. The following Aspects are recommended, but GMs and Players may decide to start with different ones.

A character's Aspects grant them a bonus or a detriment to any skills that are relevant, and over the course of the game, they will gain new ones as their character changes over time.

1. **Concept**: A broad statement about who your character is at their core. This could be as simple as "Wandering Scholar" or as specific as "Cursed Prince Seeking Redemption."

2. **Background**: Your character‚Äôs history and past experiences. Where are they from? What key events shaped them?

3. **Heritage**: The culture and species your character hails from. This can grant traits, societal expectations, or inherited abilities.

4. **Strength**: A defining strength or talent that your character possesses, whether physical, mental, or emotional. This is something they can rely on in challenging situations.

5. **Bond**: A significant relationship or connection that holds meaning for your character. It could be a person, a group, or an ideal they hold dear.

6. **Flaw**: A weakness or shortcoming that makes your character more realistic. Flaws drive tension in the narrative and create interesting story opportunities.

## Rolls
Whenever players attempt to do something, the GM decides their chance of success, from *Awful* to *Superb*, and grants them a number of D6. Players also roll the *Atomic D6*, which determines if they receive a Boon or a Bane.

If the roll is considered trivial or impossible, the GM may declare that a roll is not needed.

Rolls are always relative. For example, a player may attack with a powerful magical weapon, but if their target has exceptional armor, the GM might decide their chance of a successful attack is only "Middling," and ask them to roll 1d6.

Relative rolls are useful for resolving anything from small combats to battles between massive armies. The mechanic is still the same in a large battle. If the two sides are roughly equivalent, with the same number of advantages, the GM might rule that the player's chance of victory is still only "Middling," and they still roll just 1d6.

That's the power of the Atomic D6 Narrative Dice System: relative rolls allow the game to scale up infinitely with minimal calculation.

Skill Dice

|--------|-------------|
| 4-6    | Success     |
| 1-3    | Failure     |

| Difficulty  | Die to Roll      | % Chance of Success |

| Excellent   | 4D6 keep highest | 87%                 |
| Great       | 3D6 keep highest | 74%                 |
| Good        | 2D6 keep highest | 58%                 |
| Middling    | 1D6              | 50%                 |
| Poor        | 2D6 keep lowest  | 42%                 |

The Atomic D6
--------

| Result | Description                   |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| 5-6    | Boon, something good happens. |
| 3-4    | Nothing                       |
| 1-2    | Bane, something bad happens.  |

Example Rolls:
--------

- **Success with Boon**: The player attacks successfully, gaining an additional benefit (e.g., catching the opponent off-balance and getting a second attack).
- **Success**: The player strikes their target successfully.
- **Success with Bane**: The player hits but leaves themselves open for counterattack.
- **Failure with Boon**: The player misses, but the enemy also falters in some way.
- **Failure**: The player misses outright.
- **Failure with Bane**: The player fails and suffers an additional setback (e.g., their weapon breaks**.

## Contests

A Contest is a roll that compares the skill of two or more characters that are trying to use their abilities to oppose one another.

In such a case, the GM is expected to adjust the relative difficulty of the roll to account for the skill of the opponent. Only one party needs to roll.

The fact that only one party needs to roll gives the GM some flexibility because rolls can be resolved by either party.

The winner of a contest is usually able to do what they attempted, but there may be additional consequences for both the loser and the winner, especially if they rolled a Boon or a Bane.

## Group Rolls

Occasionally the GM and players may decide that a single roll is not enough to capture the nuance of a situation where the whole group is attempting to perform a single task.

In this case, the GM can call for a Group Roll, where each member of the group rolls, and if the majority succeeds, the group is considered to have succeeded.

For the sake of speed and simplicity, only one Atomic D6 should be rolled during a Group Roll.

**Contests between two groups**

Group Rolls can also be used in Contests. If two groups are opposing one another in a contest, the GM simply needs to adjust the difficulty of the roll accordingly.

**Contests between three or more parties**

On rare occasion there are certain "battle royale" style contests where three or more individuals or groups are all competing against one another for the same goal.

In the case of a "battle royale," the GM may call for repeated rounds of rolls. At each round, the GM is expected to make note of which parties succeeded. The rounds continue until a clear ranking has been established, and the GM may define different consequences for first place, second place, and so on.

As is the case with other Group Contests, only one Atomic D6 should be rolled during a battle royale.

## Notice / Stealth Rolls

Characters can make a Notice roll to determine whether they sense something. A character trying to Notice a target is initiating a contest against the target's Stealth.

When determining the difficulty of a Notice or Stealth roll, the GM should consider the following factors:
* Stealth of the target
* How alert is the observer?
* How noisy is the environment?
* Is the target actively trying to Stealthy?
* How good are the senses of the observer?
* Training and experience (for instance- Rangers receive Bonuses in wilderness environments)
* How much time is the observer spending trying to Notice the target?

**Noticing Inanimate Objects** works the same way, with some additional considerations that should be taken into account by the GM:

If the object has been crafted to be hidden or camouflaged, the GM can take the craftsman's skill into account when determining the difficulty of the contest.

**Group Stealth / Notice Rolls**

If an entire group of characters is attempting to Notice or Stealth, the rules for group contests apply.

Incapacitated characters automatically fail Notice Rolls.

## Reaction Rolls

The GM can call for a Reaction Roll in order to determine whether characters have time to respond to a threat.

Characters that fail to Notice a threat automatically fail their Reaction Roll to it.

Incapacitated characters also automatically fail Reaction Rolls.

## Turn-Based Play

In certain situations where many things are happening at once and time is essential, the GM may decide that turn-based play is needed. Turn-based play is not necessarily limited to combat, but it is frequently used that way.

It is recommended that GMs begin turn-based play with a Reaction Contest in order to determine which party acts first.

By default, when it is the players turn to act, they take turns around the table clockwise, but they may also decide to use an alternate turn order to coordinate their actions.

### 1) Players take Action

When a player announces their action, the GM assigns a difficulty to their roll, and they roll the appropriate number of dice.

When attacking, the difficulty of the roll should take into consideration the target's armor, their ability to parry, dodge, and resist, their level of alertness, and any other mitigating factors.

If the player succeeds on their roll, their attack is successful. A failure means their attack missed or was negated by their opponent's actions. A failure with Bane might even grant the enemy an immediate counterattack.

Players may move either before or after they attack. A typical mortal can move one zone per combat turn without magical or technological augmentation. If they do nothing except move, they may move two zones.

Players may also speak in turn-based play, but they are limited to ten syllables per turn.

### 2) Players Defend

Notably, Atomic D6 is different from other popular TTRPG systems in that it is asymmetric. NPCs usually do not roll to defend or attack. The players roll. This is in accordance with the Atomic D6 philosophy of eliminating excess rolls wherever possible.

On the NPCs turn, the GM may move them and declare their actions.

When NPCs attack, the players roll to defend. If the players fail, the attack succeeds. Whether players are attacking or defending, it bears repeating that there is only one roll. Either the attacker or the defender rolls, but usually not both.

Players may decide what kind of defensive action to take, for instance, they may dodge, block, parry, hide, counterspell, or even Judo throw. They're encouraged to be creative when narrating their actions.

Each of these actions have different difficulties depending upon the defender's situation, skills, and opponent.

For each additional attacker after the first that characters must defend against, they receive an additional Malus on their defensive rolls.

Defense and attack both come at a cost, and the GM may rule that a character in prolonged combat gains the "Fatigued" Aspect.

A Counterspell is bound by all of the same rules as any other magic spell. They are different only with regards to the fact that they are cast by a defender and they cannot take longer than one defensive turn to cast.

Counterspells do not simply cancel out enemy offensive actions: they are full fledged spells that defend by adding additional effects. For instance, an Aquamancer might summon a shield made of water to block an enemy fireball.

#### Suggestions for Defensive Actions:
* Dodge
  Jump out of the way.
* Block
  Stop the attack with a shield.
* Parry
  Knock the enemy's attack away with your weapon. Usually doesn't work against projectiles.
* Counterspell
  Cast a spell to try to negate an enemy attack.
* Judo Throw
  Use the force of the enemy attack to try to throw them with Martial Arts.
* Cover
  Hide behind something or someone
* Something else

## Quick Skirmishes

If the story warrants that a combat should be resolved quickly, the GM determines the difficulty of the entire battle and resolves it with a single roll.

Alternatively, the GM may allow each player to roll individually in order to decide their fate during the battle and how much they had to exert themselves.

---

## Large-Scale Battles

For larger battles, the GM may run a series of Quick Skirmishes.
